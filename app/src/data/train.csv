We create innovative sustainable products and build a community that celebrates and supports environmental activism and more responsible living.

Low Impact
We put sustainability at the core of everything we do. We’ve invested in a green European supply chain to minimise our waste, water, and energy footprint - and by working with the highest globally certified sustainable standards for materials and production. We use sustainability as a core focus - not just as a superficial “nice to have”. Most importantly we invest in the people and the knowledge that makes this fashion revolution possible.

Activism
We over invest in a more sustainable supply chain and in our own sustainable innovation, and we inspire activism by supporting important environmental causes. We always explain the how and why - and communicate with our customers and followers about doing what is right.

Transparency
We believe in showing the true impact of fashion - and always displaying information about where we make our clothes. In order to show the environmental impact to the customer - we’ve developed our own Impact Index - which is a tool for measuring the true cost of fashion. This tool calculates the total savings for water, waste, CO2, chemicals and energy by comparing our supply chain against the typical industry practices.

37,10668068,bbhugme,"The bbhugme Pregnancy Pillow was created for a single reason: to help make mums and babies happier by keeping them more comfortable. 

We do this through a simple but powerful idea: a pillow that helps mother and baby sit, lie and sleep comfortably throughout pregnancy and early childhood. The company is built on our Scandinavian values and medical professional experience from chiropractors.
bbhugme was created by three chiropractors from Norway, Hilde, Ann Kristin and Elisabeth, who shared a deep interest in caring for pregnant women, moms and babies. They saw many teary, sleep-deprived women who were suffering from pelvic and back pain before, during and after pregnancy. The three realized that the women needed even more support and care – a long-lasting, take-home solution that could support them beyond the care they got at the clinics. This was the origin of the bbhugme pillow.

A better pillow
The three chiropractors worked with designers to develop a unique pillow that mothers could properly count on for support. The pillow evolved from focusing on the details that matters. The optimal shape, filled with a specific type of mircobeads, gives provides sturdy, but flexible support for every body type. 

After the launch in 2013, bbhugme has won several awards in Norway and UK.

The idea to capture the beauty in simplicity and the choice of combining classic nordic elegance with a contemporary minimalist look is behind the success. DRAKENBERG SJÖLIN’s timeless design fits both the sophisticated, as well as the more fashion conscious customer. The jewellery has a Nordic signature which also appeals to the international market. Besides their own shop in Stockholm they have over 100 retailers in Sweden as well as in Norway, England and Germany.

COMPANY VALUES

TIMELESSNESS. Nature is, despite its shifts in seasons and constant surprise, a symbol for timelessness. Where a leaf has grown and then fallen to the ground, a new leaf will grow again. It stands for endless change that never stops to evoke feelings. A piece of jewellery from drakenberg sjölin can be picked up and worn again and again, no matter where or when.

SIMPLICITY. There is a strength that shouldn’t be overworked or overstated. Strength in that which can stand on it’s own but also be a part of something bigger. A DRAKENBERG SJÖLIN jewellery should always add that little extra without overshadowing the wearer’s own personality

RAW ELEGANCE. When the effortless of nature’s asymmetry meets modern design philosophy a selfevident and urban naturalness emerges. DRAKENBERG SJÖLIN stands for raw elegance that combines classical with innovation.

THOUGHTFULNESS. A piece of jewellery is something personal and, if loved, will follow a person throughout life and then live on through next generations.

Our story began in 2014 at a safe house for young girls in Kathmandu, Nepal. It was there and then our mission was born: to empower a bahini, which means little sister in Nepali, with the freedom of choice and to raise awareness about sex-trafficking. With each scarf sold, we support a bahini in need with a scholarship, and through our Fair Trade suppliers we provide our older sisters with training and employment so they too can become independent and live a life free from enslavement.

Hos Johan Christensen & Søn har vi samlet en stor ekspertise inden for Johan Christensen-huse. Henrik Lundquist har den daglige ledelse over de 11 medarbejdere, som renoverer, udbygger, vedligeholder og nytænker de første typehuse i Danmark.

Det siges, at Johan Christensens søn Holger fik ideen til de næsten 20.000 huse på en rejse til Finland i 1950'erne. Der så han, hvordan finske arkitekter opførte huse, hvor de udvendige vindues- og dørkonstruktioner samtidig var husenes bærende konstruktion. Men Holger var visionær og byggede fra starten i mahogni i stedet for fyrretræ. Mahogni er nemlig formfast, har ingen knaster og er impregneringsfrit.

Hos Johan Christensen & Søn holder vi traditionerne for de legendariske huse i hævd samtidig med, at vi nytænker løsninger for vores kunder. Mahogni er grundstammen i materialevalget, og sammen med bl.a. bæredygtig isolering med træfiber bringer vi hver dag de populære huse fra 1950'erne ind i det 21. århundrede.

Vi udfører altid vores arbejde i overensstemmelse med husenes arkitektoniske kvaliteter og historiske præg og har den specialistviden, der skal til at skifte fx vinduer og døre i husene.

Vi er Velfac-mestre og her eget snedker- og tømrerværksted, hvor vi bl.a. laver vinduesrammer, døre, reparationer på skadede dele til Johan Christensen-huse, glasarbejde, beklædningsbrædder, glaslister, indfatninger, fodpaneler, indvendige dørkarme og skydedøre. Vi løser opgaver både for private, boligforeninger, kommuner og erhverv bl.a. hoteller og virksomheder. Vi isolerer kun med træfiber, som er bæredygtigt og brandhæmmende og har egen maskine til at blæse det ind.

Johan Christensen & Søn samarbejder også med kommuner om at gøre boliger ældre- og handicapvenlige, så de ældre kan blive længere i eget hjem. Vi samarbejder desuden med en lang række forsikringsselskaber om skadessager i forbindelse med storm, vand, brand, insekter, svamp og byggesjusk.",Construction,11-50 employees,2022-02-24T22:23:38.735Z,False

The result is that you fully meet your vitamin, mineral, antioxidant, salt and Omega 3 needs. Besides water, it's the five most important elements in your body's wellbeing.

Your quality of life and health depends largely on what you eat. We modern people live in a busy everyday life, where we often choose the fast solution when it comes to food in the form of fast food and monotonous dishes. This means that we do not eat varied enough, so we do not get the necessary fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. In addition, we often get too much of some fatty acids and other nutrition, and too often you see in other manufacturers'​ dietary supplements that there is no thought about how humans are eating today. There are too often ingredients in dietary supplements we already get too much of, which is not the purpose of a dietary supplement. We want to change that in Gudenaa Pharma by introducing a wide range of dietary supplements that set the level of thoughtful quality products. We only add ingredients in our products that the modern people is short of.

Gudenaa Pharma is a Danish brand with headquarter in Copenhagen. The name originates from Denmark's longest stream, Gudenåen, and has a significant status in Denmark's history, due to its role as fishing water, transport road, power source and recreation area, and the use of the stream can be carried back to ancient times. Gudenå's original name was Guthen, which meant 'it to the gods initiated'​. Later the ‘stream’ was added. Our logo represents Gudenåen's watercourse.

Det er viktig at virksomheter kaster mer lys enn skygge på samfunnet i en stadig mer globalisert verden.

ENRICHED skal bidra til å gjøre verden sunnere. Ikke bare gjennom å gi mennesker sunne og gode produkter som bidrar til økt livskvalitet, men også gjennom måten vi lever og tenker på. Vi skal utnytte tilgjengelige ressurser på en klok måte med tanke på kommende generasjoner, slik beriker vi både kloden og menneskene.

I was the classic cliché, coffee stains on papers, a half eaten sandwich, too many browsers open, and a whole lot of pain that I was too driven to pay attention to.

 Then it hit me. My neck hurt so much that it was hard to focus. I was always tired and my productivity decreased. I found myself often getting irritable for no reason.

Then, I started talking to people. They felt the same way. I was not alone. The Modern Setup was born to help me with my pain, but it’s so much more than that. This simple stand gave me so much freedom in my life that I can’t imagine life without it. I don’t want anyone else to either! I became more productive. I had more energy. I stopped having pain and even became a kinder, more compassionate person. The right people just started showing up in my life, and now The Modern Setup has freed so many people.

 I feel privileged to have played a part in that. And I’m grateful to wake up every morning and see what difference I can make in the lives of people, families, and businesses everywhere. My next question for you is what are you ready to free yourself from?

KVALITET FRÅN FÖRR, DESIGN FÖR FRAMTIDEN
Tusen kronor räckte långt en gång i tiden. För den summan köpte vår farfar ett stycke mark 1936, byggde upp en fabrik och tillverkade radiobord. De måste ha varit riktigt bra, för snart började beställningarna av specialsnickrade möbler att rulla in. Sedan dess har generationer av stilar och materialtrender passerat, men vår grund är den samma. Fortfarande gör vi möbler som ska hålla och fungera genom livet. Och farfars omsorg om funktion och kvalitet syns än idag i detaljerna som skiljer oss så tydligt från andra.

EK, STÅL OCH ROCK N’ ROLL
”Det gifter sig i munnen” brukar man säga om smaker. Vi tänker likadant i vår kärlek till material, vår passion för form och vår vilja att ge varje detalj samma höga finish. Våra stilrena möbler ska gifta sig med omgivningen, och tillföra den där extra kryddan. Oavsett om de placeras i en ruff industriromantisk betongmiljö eller i ett traditionellt kontorslandskap.

DESIGNAR DIN ARBETSDAG
Uttrycket ”form follows function” myntades vid förra sekelskiftet av arkitekten Louis Sullivan. Formgivarens uppgift var att hitta den inneboende funktionen, så skulle den yttre formen ge sig själv. Det är lika sant idag. Varje liten detalj i våra möbler är formad för att fylla en funktion och förenkla din arbetsdag, genom alla skiftande uppgifter och moment. På det aktivitetsbaserade kontoret, får funktion en ny, bredare innebörd och vårt främsta designvärde kan bli en naturlig del av din dag.",Furniture,11-50 employees,2022-03-13T21:39:58.923Z,False

Established in 1790 and located on the Swedish west coast since 1836, Krönleins specializes in lager type beers-- pilsner and dunkel--and has received many quality awards in the Brewing Industry International Awards (BIIA) and the DLG.  

The Krönlein family has a brewing tradition that stretches six generations back in time. In 1790, a Krönlein family member marked the start of the legacy and began brewing beer in Mainstockheim, Germany. The original brewing methods introduced 200 years ago have since provided the heart of Krönleins’ brewing methodology. 

The will to maintain and honor the craftsmanship in brewing every beer to its right strength and flavor using only natural ingredients, is central to Krönleins’ brewing philosophy. We have taken a firm step away from commercial, artificial brewing methods and we are very proud to operate under the Naturbryggt® certificate. Krönleins believe in brewing as an uninterrupted process in which each beer reaches its optimal state without additives, preservatives, and water dilution. Our philosophy gives the beer an unbeatable character, a complex depth of tastes, and an outstanding drinking experience. 

Krönleins is the world’s most successful non-German brewery in what is known to be the strictest quality assessment of beer, the German DLG. In 2009, Krönleins was the first ever non-German brewery to be awarded with the Gold ‘Preis der Besten,’ the most sought after and prestigious prize in the DLG for 10 consecutive years of brewing mastery. 

We hold several prizes from the International Brewing Awards—The World Championships for Beer—with the latest addition to our prize collection in 2013. The successes of Krönleins show that a Swedish artisan brewery can meet and even surpass the standards of the international brewing elite.",Food & Beverages,51-200 employees,2022-03-13T21:40:02.886Z,False

Vi som arbetar här har länge jobbat med både mat- och näthandel, och 2016 samlade vi all vår erfarenhet för att börja bygga vår drömbutik. Vi på Fodi har en väldigt tydlig målsättning; att förändra sättet svenskarna handlar mat på. Det låter kanske lite väl ambitiöst, men vi tror att vi har verktygen för att lyckas.

Tänk dig att på ett enkelt och snabbt sätt kunna göra veckohandlingen från mobilen på väg hem från jobbet och få den levererad till ditt hem gratis – istället för att åka till butiken och själv bära hem maten. Tack vare vår digitala produkt kan vi erbjuda just detta; ett enklare, snabbare och roligare sätt för våra kunder att handla mat på.

Vi nöjer oss dock inte där. Utöver alla fantastiska fördelar finns också vissa nackdelar med den digitala utvecklingen. När handlingen flyttas online, bort från charken och in i surfplattan, går det personliga mötet mellan kund och handlare ofta förlorat. Det tycker vi är otroligt synd och därför är en viktig del av vår vision att istället återskapa känslan av personlig kundservice samt att vara en del av det lokala ekosystemet.

Vi vill fokusera på ett område i taget och göra det så bra vi bara kan. Vi lyssnar på vad våra kunder tycker om oss, vad de vill ha och när de vill ha det. Vi tror inte att en stark digital tjänst räcker. Vi tror istället att den glädje vi kan sprida genom riktigt bra och personlig service är det som i slutändan kan få oss att ändra sättet vi handlar mat på.

Naturligvis handler det om mad i Maaltidet – faktisk enorme mængder på daglig basis – men det handler om så uendeligt meget mere end det

Maaltidet leverer hver dag i omegnen af 4000 kuverter til 150 virksomheder, og det siger sig selv, at der ligger stor faglighed, store gryder og en massiv planlægning bag det hele.  Det er sådan set ikke sværere at lave mad til mange end til få, når man har det rette udstyr, men udfordringen er, at få tilsat det ekstra, særlige og altafgørende krydderi: Kærlighed!

Vi er en virksomhed, der sætter uhøjtidelighed og humor øverst på dagsordenen hver eneste dag. Det skal være både sjovt, hyggeligt og fagligt udfordrende at gå på arbejde i Maaltidet, og her er altid højt til loftet.

Professionalismen giver sig selv, da kun de dygtigste bliver ansat, og i sammenkog med ovenstående og en stor dedikation, leverer vi hver dag retter med både næring, smag, kærlighed og godt humør.

Måske kunne man tro, at vi slipper vores mad i det øjeblik det forlader matriklen og bliver kørt ud til de mange arbejdspladser. Vi mener selv at vi følger med. Vi tror nemlig på, at den energi og stemning vi har her i huset, afspejler sig i maden, kanaliserer sig videre ud i frokoststuerne og danner basis for de gode oplevelser. Og det er præcis det vi gerne vil give vores gæster. 

Vores overordnede vision er, at gøre mennesker glade – maden er i den sammenhæng sekundær – og da vores kunder faktisk er glade, er vi stolte af, at Maaltidet er så meget mere end mad!",Food & Beverages,51-200 employees,2022-03-13T21:40:32.014Z,False

Beans startade 2002 av 3 engagerade personer som alla kommit fram till samma slutsats ”ska det vara så svårt att leverera gott kaffe till kontor!” 
 
Kaffe och kafferasten är en otroligt viktig del av en arbetsdag. Därför skulle den kaffeleverantör som engagerade sig mest för smakupplevelsen också kunna göra stort intryck på marknaden. Med den insikten för ögonen skapades konceptet “Garanterad Smak” som blev grunden till allt fortsatt arbete.
 
I takt med att verksamheten blev större ville grundarna också ta ett större ansvar. Det resulterade i Beans arbete för ett hållbart samhälle,”Ett Smakfullt Engagemang”.
 
Idag är Beans ett av Sveriges snabbast växande företag i vår bransch. 2009 blev vi av tidningen Dagens Industri utsedd till ett av Sveriges gasellföretag.

Og netop smagen har været det centrale lige siden starten i 2002. Vi ved, at seks stjerner, fine anmeldelser og en god historie intet er værd, hvis ikke vinen falder i netop din smag. Derfor gør vi meget ud af at teste de mange vine, vi opdager på vores rejser.

GOD VIN SIDEN 2002 
Siden 2002 har vi kigget mod de fjerneste afkroge af verden og afsøgt ukendte vinmarker for at hente nye smagsoplevelser hjem til Danmark og resten af Skandinavien.

VI PASSER PÅ PRISEN
Vi henter kun vine hjem til Danmark, hvor vi er den eneste importør. Vi kender den enkelte vinbonde og handler ude hos ham eller hende, så mellemhandlere og dyre distributører ikke lægger ekstra på prisen.

STÆRKE I SYDAMERIKA
Glud Vin har i årevis rejst rundt på støvede grusveje i Argentina, Chile, Uruguay og andre eksotiske egne. Alligevel har vi kun lige skrabet i overfladen af det skattekammer, som den sydamerikanske vinkultur udgør.

VIN FRA HELE VERDEN
Vi har en forkærlighed for oversøisk vin. Derfor finder du udover Sydamerika
også altid gode vine på lager fra lande som Sydafrika, Australien og New Zealand.

Glud Vin kan også tilbyde dig de traditionelle vinoplevelser fra Europa. Og de seneste år har vi udforsket ukendte vinmarker i nabolaget til de populære europæiske vinområder. Her er store vinoplevelser, der bare venter på at blive opdaget.

Toiminta-ajatuksenamme on vuodesta 1995 alkaen ollut laadullisesti ja mielikuvallisesti ylivoimaisten juomien valmistaminen. Toiminta-ajatuksen toteuttaminen aloitettiin valmistamalla vanhan ajan limonaadeja hyvin vaatimattomissa puitteissa, Fazerin vanhassa munanporaamossa, Laitilassa. Nostalgisia juomia tehtiin käsityönä ja itse tehdyillä laitteilla, aina etikettien liimausta myöten. Asiaan kuului, että kenelläkään limonaadin valmistajista ei ollut tietoa alasta, mutta tekemisen palo oli suuri. Ensimmäisen limonaadipullon osti laitilalainen herrasmies Poukanmäen perinnepäivillä, eikä ole vielä tullut laadusta valittamaan.

Ohutlompsaisilla tehtailijoilla ei ollut varaa panimolaitteiston hankkimiseen, joten 1997 tuotevalikoimaa laajennettiin Oiva siiderillä. Siideri saavutti kiitettävää kunniaa ja sinkosi toiminnan huimaan nousuun, mutta silti tehtailijoiden ajatuksissa kyti panemisen palo. Vihdoin 1999 löytyi paikallisen yrityksen romulavalta vanha meijerisäiliö. Siihen kytkettiin putkiliikkeestä ostettu höyryä tuottava jäätyneiden putkistojen sulatuspoltin, ja näin syntyi Laitilan ensimmäinen panimolaitteisto – ”Steam Beer Boiler”, siinä pannun Kukko Höyryoluen mukaan.

Paljon on noista ajoista vettä Sirppujoessa virrannut.

Finnfoamin tavoitteena on aina ollut tuottaa kustannustehokkaita eristysratkaisuja asiakkaillemme. Tuotekehityksemme yksi ensisijaisista tavoitteistamme onkin lisätä tuotteen käyttöikää. Lukuisat innovaatiot ovat johtaneet patentteihin ja luoneet onnistuneita tuotteita, jotka ovat vaikuttaneet kansainväliseen kasvuun. Viime vuosina olemme keskittyneet kansainvälistymään jättämättä kuitenkaan nykyisen asiakaskunnan kasvavia tarpeita. Suomen lisäksi Finnfoamilla on tuotantoa Liettuassa, Espanjassa ja pian myös Ruotsissa.

Laadun lisäksi Finnfoam panostaa voimakkaasti ympäristöystävällisyyteen. Finnfoamin valmistuksessa käytettävä hiilidioksidi on muiden tehtaiden jätettä eikä Finnfoam-eristeen valmistusprosessista synny jätettä, sillä tuotannossa syntyvä hukka kierrätetään tehtaalla uudelleen käyttöön. Finnfoam oli aikoinaan ensimmäinen XPS-eristeiden valmistaja maailmassa, joka luopui kokonaan jalokaasujen käytöstä.

We provide floor protection mats, reducing the dirt brought into our customers premises and saving on overall cleaning costs.

Research has found that over 75% of the dust and dirt in buildings is walked in from outside, often amounting to several kilos of dirt every day. Floor protection mats trap this dirt and moisture, preventing it from being spread throughout the building. We launder your mats regularly, leaving them much fresher and smarter than simple vacuum cleaning can achieve.",Textiles,11-50 employees,2022-03-18T09:37:49.804Z,False

Baban herkkujen – hummuksen, babaganoushin, oliivitahnan, chiliporkkanoiden ym. takana on rakastettu perheen pää Avi, joka puhuu hassua suomea.

Avi tuli Suomeen yli 40-vuotta sitten. Saapuessaan hänellä oli olallaan kassi, jossa oli nuoren miehen omaisuus sekä oman äidin ikivahat reseptit. Niiden pohjalta tehdyt herkut ovat menneet suun kautta sydämeen ensin Persiassa, sitten Avin valmistamina täällä Suomessa. Nyt ruokaperinnettä jatkaa perheyritys Baba Foods, jota luotsaavat Avin lapset samalla avimaisella rakkaudella ja intohimolla ihanaan ruokaan. Heillä puhe sujuu selvällä suomella, mutta sydän lyö sopivasti Lähi-idän tahtiin.

Babassa halutaan tehdä parasta. Niin hyvää, että äly lähtee. Siksi Baban herkut tehdään käsin, parhaista raaka-aineista ja mahdollisimman pitkälti ilman lisäaineita. Asiakkaansa Baba haluaa pitää super-tyytyväisenä. Tässä on onnistuttu hyvin. Ja kun joskus ollaan mokattu, niin siitä on otettu opiksi. Babalaiset todella arvostavat saamaansa palautetta. Jos ylpistymme, olemme epäonnistuneet. Siksi haluamme palvella juuri sinua mahdollisimman hyvin.

Baba toimii rehellisesti, vastuullisesti ja eettisesti sekä mahdollisimman ekologisesti. Se ei ole aina helppoa, mutta yrittäjät tekevät aina parhaansa.

Magnus Gustafsson, the founder of GSL, was at the time sponsored by the British brand, who have always chosen to sponsor a SINGLE international player – someone with the right personality and attitude on the court. Magnus got to know Fred Perry’s MD and when it was time to start looking for something to do after his tennis career, he was given the chance to become a distributor for the brand in Sweden. In 1997, together with his brother Anders Gustafsson, he founded Gustafsson’s Sport and Leisure.

Since 1997, GSL has developed in two directions: fashion – with a focus on men’s fashion and quality, and tennis – with a focus on rackets and materials. We currently work with these two business areas separately, but in close cooperation towards the same goal: to become Scandinavia’s best brand manager.

The essence of Finnish happiness comes from having a close relationship with nature and its unique light. Our purpose at Honka is to bring the life force of the northern woods and sunshine into people’s lives. This is why we create healthy homes and buildings from renewable wood.

A tree that has grown in the northern woods is a work of art created by nature: it grows stronger in the extreme sub-zero conditions and stores in itself the light of the nightless summer nights. A Honka log home is a lasting legacy for future generations. Construction is the most environmentally conscious use of wood because as trees grow, they absorb carbon dioxide, which remains stored for the entire lifecycle of the building. Certified, renewable wood is a building material that is sustainable, durable and healthy – and energising.

Ever since the Saarelainen brothers founded Honka in 1958, we have studied wood and learned to appreciate its uniqueness. Each Honka log home is not just a work of art created by nature, but a masterpiece of Finnish design craftsmanship. In Karstula, central Finland, we manufacture buildings that are good for people.

The Honka yellow is the colour of hope and joy for us. Nature teaches us to see the good in life and to understand that even the smallest of deeds make a difference. We want to help our customers achieve the dreams that matter the most to them. We are honoured to bring the life force of the northern woods.

Honka® is a registered trademark of Honkarakenne Plc. It encapsulates our family business’s expertise and love of log construction spanning more than 60 years. Our log houses have been sold the most in the world – over 85,000 Honka buildings around the globe.

A carpenter by trade, Wiktor was determined to create a backpack that would withstand the necessary journeys through the country, no matter the conditions. From humble beginnings, Haglöfs’ story evolved, and so did the offerings. Seeking constant progress, Haglöfs have ventured into new territory, creating technical designs that set a new standard in craftsmanship and committing to do what can be done to ensure that the outdoors will still be there for future generations to explore.

Although Tretorn can be found in stores all over the world, from Paris and New York to Tokyo and Berlin, Tretorn remains inherently Swedish. Drawing inspiration from the Nordic way of living, we fuse a love of nature with urban purpose. Our heritage and rich expertise in rubber-based products have given us the intrepidity to develop collections that rise to any rough weather occasion. 

Our first products were driven by functional needs: high-quality rubber galoshes primarily used by villagers, fishermen and the military. Then came the iconic tennis shoe. As sportswear became the height of fashion in the 1960s,it was clear that Tretorn could design shoes that were as popular on the pages of fashion magazines as they were on the tennis court. And we’ve done whatever it takes, from pushing the boundaries of the technology to making rubber boots by hand to ensure that no shower gets in the way of the everyday life outside. The brand unites function with design and style, offering collections that embody an updated and modern timelessness. Decade after decade, we’ve stood strong – whatever the weather – and developed products that are made for enjoying the outside.

Swedese's ideals are the same today as they have been for the past sixty years. These are to create beautiful furniture for the future, which build on the foundations of Scandinavian modern traditions, designed by forward-looking designers who share in the timeless ideals of architecture.

Swedese was founded in 1945 by the two brothers Yngve and Jerker Ekström and Sven Bertil Sjöqvist, with Yngve leading the company until his death. The present owner of Swedese is Mrs. Elisabeth Johansson. The headquarters are located to Vaggeryd in Småland, Sweden, where one of the factories can be found. The second factory is located in Äng, a small village outside Nässjö, Sweden.

Many modernist architects were universal designers with not only a clear understanding of designing houses, but also the interior, the furniture and almost the clothes the owners might wear. Swedese's founder, Yngve Ekström, was no exception. Together with names including Alvar Aalto, Bruno Mathsson, Arne Jacobsen and Poul Kjaerholm, Yngve Ekström was at the core of a generation of designers who made the concept ""Scandinavian Modern""​ famous all over the world. With a keen eye, he designed Swedese's furniture, he designed together with L + M Architects also the head office building, logo, catalogues and personalised Christmas cards including their own poems. And so on.

The most well known design of Yngve Ekström's extensive portfolio is the Lamino armchair from 1956, which is still manufactured and sold all over the world. In 1999 the Lamino was voted the Twentieth Century's Best Swedish Furniture Design by the Swedish interior design magazine Sköna Hem.",Furniture,51-200 employees,2022-03-18T09:40:21.980Z,False

We challenge ourselves to innovate, thereby challenging the boundaries within our industry and the expectations of consumers.

Functional garments that kept the wearer dry and happy whatever the weather.

Our garments are made for everyone, for you and me. For everyday people, aged 1 to 100 years old. Didriksons once started out as a family company, and we still act like one. We love the family. Our concept is to create functional clothes, with a timeless design, to be worn every day, no matter what the weather.

Today the world is different than it was when we started. That means we have to take better care of it. We constantly develop our environmental work, and strive to reduce our footprints in this world. We minimize chemicals, we ban all toxic substances, and we try to reduce our use of water, energy and transportation as much as we can. This is an ongoing work, and we’ll probably never finish.

- We meticulously identify the potential environmental impact of all our operations and make sure to always compensate for emissions resulting from shipping & travel.

Oscar Jacobson grundade sitt skrädderi 1903 i Borås. Ända sen starten har företagets filosofi utmärkts av en passion inför det gedigna hantverket, snillrika detaljer och tidlös stil. Idag bygger Oscar Jacobsons design på tre huvudelement: anglosaxiskt kulturarv, italiensk skräddarkonst och skandinavisk enkelhet. Som en känd författare en gång sa, handlar stil om att stå ut i mängden utan att det verkar som om man har gjort någon ansträngning. Att ha en bra stil handlar också om att vara tydlig. Ingenting är osagt, svamligt eller komplicerat. En annan författare formulerade det så här: ”Stil är att veta vem du är, vad du vill, och att inte bry dig ett skvatt”.

Vår egna produktionslokal ligger i Årsta utanför Stockholm. Här tillverkar vi unika produkter som är både gluten och laktosfria och även raw. Större delen av vårt sortiment är ekologiskt och vegan. Vårt mål är att ta fram nya, spännande produkter som ligger i framkant och som erbjuder kunderna ett unikt sortiment. Vi vill förändra världen med kniv och gaffel.
Ibland kan det dyka upp frågor kring produkterna som hur de kan användas. Vi arbetar aktivt med recept, inspiration och tips kring våra produkter. Vi svarar även på produktfrågor via vår infomail. Följ oss gärna på Instagram och Facebook för inspiration.

Vi är medvetna om att mat och transporter har en miljöpåverkan. Vi planerar våra långväga transporter genom samköp, vi undviker flyg och fraktar hellre med båt. I vår egna produktion och på kontoret källsorterar vi de olika materialen för återvinning. Vi vill inspirera till en miljösnäll vardag genom att äta mer grön mat. På jobbet lagas och serveras dagligen lunch till alla medarbetare, mestadels vegetarisk mat baserad på ekologiska råvaror i säsong.",Food Production,11-50 employees,2022-03-18T09:40:46.707Z,False

991,18650872,Lejonet&Björnen,"Det hela började i en liten lokal på Räntmästaregatan i stadsdelen Lunden i Göteborg.
Här köade folk för att köpa glass eller sorbet.
Hemligheten? Den smakade precis som den var framställd. Hemgjord, helt enkelt.
Konceptet har hängt med sedan dess.
2009 tog Katarina och Håkan Mild över företaget och bestämde sig för att expandera och utveckla. Men de båda lovade varandra att villkoren var som tidigare.
Naturliga och noga utvalda råvaror främst från lokala, regionala och nationella leverantörer.
Ett hantverk som kunderna verkligen känner smaken utav. I fabriken i Göteborg, där vi är ett litet men noga utvalt team som jobbar, kokas det varje år kilovis av vaniljstänger. Varför? Hur ska man annars göra? Jordgubbar, och andra bär som blandas i glassen, väljs med stor omsorg och alltid av högsta kvalitet. Ni ska dessutom veta att vår glassmästare Anders har en unik förmåga för att hitta smaker som tillsammans smälter i munnen.

Färgämne är ett okänt begrepp hos Lejonet & Björnen. Det finns ingen anledning att veta exakt vad det innebär eftersom det aldrig har eller kommer att ingå i det vi kallar vardagslyx.
För oss innebär inte KRAV och Fair Trade ett måste, utan ett välkommet ansvar. Där vi anser att vi med våra beslut kan göra skillnad i viktiga frågor som hänsyn till djur, människa och miljö.

Om Lejonet & Björnen från 70-talet blev ett lokalt begrepp i Göteborg har varumärket vuxit sig allt starkare och finns idag i livsmedelsbutiker, caféer och restauranger i hela landet.

Vi erbjuder ett sortiment som innehåller fler än 40 olika glass– och sorbetsorter.

På Danska Vägen i Göteborg har vi dessutom vårt eget stolta glasscafé, som naturligtvis heter Lejonet & Björnen och som precis som exempelvis Feskekörka, Poseidon, Heden och en halv special blivit en känd del av staden.

Nirvan Richter, founder and architect, wanted to design furniture he felt the market was lacking: high-quality furniture of natural materials that would last and could, if necessary, be repaired or reupholstered and passed on from generation to generation. Furniture whose design is timeless and offered an alternative to mass-produced furniture for rapid turnover. 

We decided early on to work solely with natural materials, for two very good reasons:

- Purely environmental. Our aim is to create products that are part of the natural cycle, which we do by using renewable raw materials.
- Lasting beauty. For Norrgavel, natural materials is also an aesthetic choice - they stimulate the senses, can be kept in good condition and generally age beautifully. It´s about the sensation you get from running your hand over a soft soap-finished piece of oak, or feeling the different qualities of linen. 

In 1998, Norrgavel became the first comany to acquire the Nordic Swan Ecolabel for home furniture. The following year we received the Swedish furniture industry´s environment prize, awarded in conjunction with WWF. Several pieces of Norrgavel furniture have since received design awards, with environmental credentials often cited by the jury.

“In the 90’s Photoshop wasn’t an option, and therefore your skin had to look perfect. Working as a model, my skin quickly became one of my most important tools for work.” says Emma.

During periods Emma did experience some problems with her skin, and she got in contact with a French dermatologist that helped her to sort through the jungle of available skincare products. She recommended products you could find at the French pharmacies, products with safe and effective ingredients with well-documented results – and it worked.

Våra sömmerskor följer plagget hela vägen och namnetiketten är inte bara en kvalitetssäkring utan ger också dig möjlighet att förstå att det finns en människa bakom varje plagg. En människa med mycket stor kunskap om ett hantverk.

Woolpower tillverkar underställ, förstärkningsplagg, sockor och accessoarer. Tillverkningen sker i Östersund från garn till färdig produkt. Av garnet stickar vi vårt unika material Ullfrotté Original och efter beredningen tar sömmerskorna över. Fabriken i Östersund har funnits sedan 1969 och i dag är vi ungefär 100 anställda.

Ullen vi använder kommer från får som lever i Uruguay och i den Argentinska delen av Patagonien. All ull är helt mulesingfri. Det vet vi med säkerhet eftersom problemet med Blåflugan, som är orsaken till mulesing, inte existerar i Sydamerika. Det är den enkla anledningen till varför vi köper ull därifrån. Det är viktigt för oss att varken människa djur eller natur ska lida för vår produktions skull.

1135,51057563,Wästberg,"Our aim is to create well-being through good light.

In close collaboration with leading architects and designers, Wästberg creates long-lasting, technologically driven, economically viable and environmentally conscious lighting. Lighting that answers to fundamental human needs, both
physical and emotional, and adapts to these needs as they evolve and shift.

In our 2008 manifesto Lamps for Neanderthal Man, we pointed out man’s primitive relationship to light in the form of fire. For more than a million years, fire was our only artificial light source. It frightened off wild animals, brought us together, kept us warm and made us feel safe. Above all, it was a light source that we could keep close, that we could control. 

Electric light has been around for little more than a century – a blink of an eye in comparison with human evolution. Today, we find ourselves trying to tame our primitive needs to meet the demands of a modern, high-tech world, where light has more or less become a world of electronics. In our overly-lit spaces – created under the mistaken notion that more light equals greater productivity – we feel exposed, small, with nowhere to go.

We believe in creating modern-day fires. Light should shine for us, not on us. 

We also believe in lighting that answers to fundamental human needs. The need to be able to see, read and write, but also to reflect, envision and imagine. The need to be a part of a dynamic social context, but also to be able to withdraw to a personal sphere of familiarity and safety.

Technology and innovation are at the heart of what we do and are crucial to providing good light. However, we understand that what’s technically possible is not always humanly preferable. To us, true innovation means making the effort to find the best possible solutions, putting equal effort into both the measurable and the immeasurable",Furniture,11-50 employees,2022-03-18T09:41:15.238Z,True

Not for art or cost-efficiency, but for those who will use it.
We make our furniture for your home. For the hotel, you visit and the dining-rooms you eat in. For your meals, your meetings, your moments for yourself.
For us, every piece of furniture has its own purpose. We make each piece in a unique way. Yet always with the same idea.
It must be beautiful to look at, lovely to sit in and durable enough to use. Over and over again.
That’s why we started Gärsnäs, where the timber grew next to the factory. Ash, oak and beech. With passionate craftsmanship that respects every growth ring. And a devotion to passing knowledge on.

It has been 125 years now, and we still follow the same philosophy today. With the same materials, in the same factory, with the same skills created over generations.
But our most important work is not done in Gärsnäs.
It is done everywhere.
For us, every piece of furniture is a journey of discovery. An exploration through time and space. Through the history of craftsmanship and the future of design. To the place where our furniture meets you who will use it.
If we are to make furniture for people, then we must never stop wondering. Never stop asking and never stop being astonished. We have to always search, try, fail and improve until each angle is well thought-out and every detail has a purpose.
This is how we build furniture at Gärsnäs.
With classic craftsmanship.
Genuine materials.
And a never-ending curiosity.

Gärsnäs was founded in 1897. It is a family-owned company, managed since 2003 by Anna and Dag Klockby along with Åke Axelsson. Åke designed his first chair for Gärsnäs in 1963 and since then he has designed over 100 more. Production takes place in Gärsnäs, Skåne, but if you would like to see and feel our furniture, then visit our showroom in Stockholm. On Skeppsbron we have furnished a suite of rooms for you to experience the furniture in its proper setting. Welcome!

1148,12663176,Morris Stockholm,"Fashion is a funny thing. The word implies constant change – always moving on to the next big thing, the next trend and the next look. That’s not Morris. We prefer the word curious – and as a brand you could say that we’re style curious. That means that Morris prefers to rush slowly. The results are always better that way. We know who we are, where we’re coming from, and also where we’re going. Let’s take it from the beginning.

The name Morris comes from the legendary men’s shop, which was located on Hamngatan in central Stockholm from 1949 to the beginning of the 70s. Morris was the destination of choice for gentlemen of all ages. The store attracted dandies throughout the country with a passion for British-made clothing and accessories that were synonymous with quality.

“I thought the historic connection was amusing, but Morris is also a good name. It’s as simple as that really,” says Jan Alsén, the founder of Morris. 

Our style foundation and inspiration comes from the classically preppy, but mixed with an ample portion of contemporary and innovative influences, and a dose of obstinacy. Geographically, we firmly belong on this side of the Atlantic. We’ve borrowed classic old-world charm and convention from the British with a bit of eccentricity thrown in. The streets of Paris, Milan and Rome taught us chic elegance, and a certain nonchalant “joie de vivre.” And from Sweden and Scandinavia, our place of birth, we learned about design, quality and straightforwardness – useful character traits when bringing Morris out into the world.

Fashion does change from season to season, even for Morris. But being style curious rather then trend driven, we’re selective in what we pick up and mix into each collection. Often it’s rediscovering classic pieces, and giving them an update in design, material and colour. All Morris collections are carefully curated – every single garment or accessory has our love and approval, and hopefully our customers’ too.

Historik
Utvecklingen av Hammerglass AB startade 1993. Då arbetade vi tillsammans med Göteborgs stads eget försäkringsbolag Göta Lejon för att hitta ett sätt att minska kostnaderna för glasskador. Uppdraget var väldefinierat: ""Hitta en lösning eller så börjar vi mura för fönstren""​.
Efter att ha tagit fram tilläggssystem för utvändigt montage av okrossbart fönsterglas började vi fundera på att utveckla ett isolerglas med samma okrossbara egenskaper. Projektet lyckades och Hammerglass kan idag kan lämna 5 års full isolerglasgaranti på Hammerglass Isoler. Det unika ytskiktet som alla Hammerglass-rutor är belagda med ger glasen ett utomordentligt repskydd, samt ett 99,96%-igt UV-skydd.

Hammerglass AB erbjuder trygghet och säkerhet genom att tillverka och leverera kundspecifika okrossbara glasningslösningar.

Skene Järns historia har präglats av djärva satsningar och en framsynthet som många har tvivlat på, men kritiken har oftast tystnat när resultaten har visat sig. Satsningen på båtar 1966 är legendarisk, i inlandskommunen Mark finns därmed en av de butiker där det säljs flest båtar i landet.

From the outside, we're a catering company with culinary awards and horizontal expansion ambitions bringing scalable craftsmanship to smash the flexibility ceiling of the industrial world.

Gastronaut transcends traditional production model limitations with a decentralised model that scales physical assets with the same ease, speed and cost as scaling software. We develop and coordinate a proprietary network of independent cloud-kitchens (quite different from the ones you are used to reading about) to produce a complex catering service for a single buyer, and a single cloud-kitchen to produce simultaneously for multiple buyers.  

Gastronaut works only with talented international chefs who bring specialised craftsmanship and refined flavours exclusively from their home countries in order to secure a premium food experience. Thanks to our innovative business model, we’re able to bring this premium food experience to our customers at mid-level prices.  

Whenever our clients and their guests enjoy our catering service they directly contribute to creating jobs, integration opportunities and financial sustainability for immigrants, without doing or paying anything extra. Moreover, 80% of our chefs are female, in this male dominated industry.

Följ gärna ISBJÖRN of Sweden på Cision, Instagram @isbjornofsweden och på Facebook.

Nordic KidsWear AB was founded 2005 by Maria Frykman Forsberg and Camilla Schmidt. The business idea was born when they had their first babies, not finding proper outdoor gear for their little ones in order to keep their outdoor lifestyle. Children wear is often connected and decorated with cuddly bears.These garments were made to endure a tougher climate and a harder use. So it came as a rather natural choice to pick the toughest bear on the planet as a symbol for the brand – the polar bear. The ISBJÖRN of Sweden collection covers the age from 0-16 years, offering all necessary layers you might need for your child being active outdoors, at day care center or in the spare time with the family. The collection was launched in the most exclusive outdoor shops in Sweden and today the brand is distributed by over 250 exclusive retailers in Scandinavia, Europe and Japan. The success factor for ISBJÖRN of Sweden is to bring true product sustainability into the children wear market, by offering products
in the same high quality as for premium adult outdoor wear and also by taking an environmental friendly approach when choosing the materials. It is quite simple actually - “What is best for your child is also best for the environment”.

1418,10356201,Flinks Järn,"""Vår enda uppgift är att göra yrkesfolkets vardag enklare.""

Flinks är snabbgrossar bara för yrkesfolk

Flinks Järn är ett familjeägt företag som startade i Stockholm redan 1907. Vi finns idag med fem snabbgrossar på 2500 kvadratmeter vardera för yrkesfolket i Storstockholm.  Sortimentet omfattar ca 20 000 noga utvalda artiklar med över 99 % leveranssäkerhet. 

Men vi vill inte bara leverera ett brett sortiment av produkter, vi vill även bidra med vårt kunnande. Vi brukar säga att vi inte bara säljer en produkt utan att vi säljer en lösning. Hos oss möts du av kunnig personal, många med bakgrund i olika hantverksyrken, för att ge yrkesfolket en bra och snabb service. Kom in till oss så tar vi tillsammans fram den bästa lösningen för just ditt behov. 

Vi har öppet alla helgfria vardagar 06.00 - 17.00 året runt.  

Flinks sortiment bestäms av säljarna ”på golvet”

Det är ute i yrkesfolkets vardag som det avgörs vilka produkter som håller måttet och vilka som inte gör det och vi vill att det ska vara så kort väg som möjligt mellan tillverkarna och dig som användare. Därför är det personalen du möter i våra snabbgrossar som även bestämmer vårt sortiment. Inte en inköpschef på ett kontor i Göteborg eller Antwerpen. 

Flinks fokuserar på kostnad inte på pris.

""Vad kostar varan?"" En vanlig fråga vid valet av leverantör. På Flinks Järn tycker vi att du borde ställa en annan fråga: ""Vilka kostnader tänker min leverantör bespara mig?"" Vi tror att det är viktigare för dig att titta på din egen timtid istället för att leta efter tillfälliga kampanjpriser. Ditt eget arbete kostar betydligt mer än själva varan du köper. Ju mindre tid du behöver ägna åt att hitta rätt vara och att transportera den, desto mer dyrbar arbetstid spar du. Vi ser det som vårt uppdrag att hjälpa dig att sänka dina totalkostnader.",Building Materials,51-200 employees,2022-03-18T09:42:12.967Z,False

Les Deux was born from a chance meeting between two very different people, with contrasting personalities, who found themselves united in recognising opportunities. Two distinct souls on divergent paths with shared ambitions.

Often, in the meeting of opposites, something profound happens. A spark ignites.It is then you can excel and stand out from the crowd – you can dare to carve your own path. This is our raison d’être. We design clothes that make people challenge their habits, confront the status quo. We do what it takes - and we do it with a shared sense of purpose.

Some might say that you are as classy as the clothes you wear. At Les Deux, we
believe true class is shown by your actions. Class is consideration, compassion,
and the willingness to give your all. We never give up. We give back. We share our success, and we persevere. We work as one but let each individual pursue their own dream. Les Deux is about leaving a mark – a legacy that has lasting meaning. Ensuring sustainability and compassion are at the heart of what we create, our designs and our communication – and how we give back.

We say: believe in what you do and get the job done. Life has its own driving forces and so do we. Opposites spark opportunites.

Embrace difference.

Hos Frankly Juice har vi taget kampen op med især juice producenter, som vi til tider mener lukrerer på nogle af de trends og buzzwords, som figurerer i fødevarebranchen løbende, for på den måde, at sælge deres produkter som værende sunde. Vores bud på hvorledes en juice skal kunne defineres som værende sund er, at råvaren er frisk og økologisk, presset i bedst mulige temperaturer for bevarelse af mest mulig smag og næring og uden tilsætning af nogen art. En juice presset friskt af konventionelle råvarer kan i virkeligheden være en koncentreret mængde af giftstoffer fra pesticidrester og det skal folk bare vide inden de vælger det som en ”sund vane”. 

Buzzwords som ”koldpresset”, ”ingefær”, ”havtorn”, ”protein”, ”glutenfri” og mange flere kan IKKE i sig selv være garanti for, at et produkt er sundt – det handler mest af alt om kvaliteten/friskheden af den råvarer der er blevet brugt. Og det kan ofte være misvisende for forbrugeren. Det vil vi gerne være med til at skabe gennemsigtighed og ærlighed omkring, således at folk er rustet til at træffe deres valg om eventuelle sunde vaner. Både for dem selv og for miljøet. Frankly betyder som nævnt ”helt ærligt” og er vores bud på et ægte buzzword!

Frøslev Træ A/S, som virksomheden hedder i dag - blev startet i 1931 af Johannes Carlsen på grundstykket, som hustruen Mariane havde fået i medgift. Johannes Carlsen begyndte savværksvirksomhed under trange og slidsomme kår, hvor Hans Hansen, den lokale skraldemand, med hest slæbte træstammerne ud af skoven og med hestevogn transporterede træet hjem til forarbejdning på savværket i Frøslev. Det var et opslidende arbejde, hvor han ene mand måtte læsse de tunge træstammer.

Til opskæringen havde Johannes Carlsen i begyndelsen én enkelt fritstående sav, der blev trukket af en gammel, larmende petroleumsmotor. Denne var overdækket med et primitivt tag båret af en nedgravet granpæl i hvert hjørne, hvorved han fik ly for vejr og vind. Virksomheden blev under 2. verdenskrig brugt som tilholdssted for danske frihedskæmpere. Savværket var i familien Carlsens eje frem til 1978, hvor Jens P. L. Petersen og Fuglsang Savværk købte det til eksportvirksomhed og lager med Jens P. L. Petersen som primus motor og daglig leder. I 1982 overtog Jens P. L. Petersen savværket, og i de følgende år blev der løbende foretaget moderniseringer.

I perioden frem til 1985 blev der savet omkring 30.000 m3 pr. år. I november 1985 blev Frøslev Savværk desværre flammernes bytte, hvor både produktionsbygninger og maskiner nedbrændte til grunden. Savværket lå stille indtil 1988, hvor Jens P. L. Petersen og hustru Christa L. Petersen atter pustede liv i det, nu under navnet Frøslev Træ. Virksomheden blev ændret til en handels- og engrosvirksomhed med speciale i forarbejdet og/eller trykimprægneret fyrtømmer.

Sønnen Martin L. Petersen indtrådte i januar 2011, som et led i et planlagt generationsskifte, i den daglige ledelse. I slutningen af 2012 overtog Martin L. Petersen virksomheden, efter endelig gennemførelse af generationsskiftet.

METTE SKJÆRBÆK - FOUNDER / 

Natural health has intrigued me since I was young, living in Denmark. At age 16, I left Denmark for my career as a model, and it led me to the world’s farthest corners and the largest metropolises. Ten years later, I returned to lovely Denmark with a broad knowledge of health, beauty, fashion, design, diverse cultures and the strong belief that there is NO BEAUTY WITHOUT TRUTH.

Karmameju reflects my love for natural beauty, health, positive thinking, and the art of natural perfumery. Ten years in the beauty and fashion industries and my participation in a ‘Bachelor of Science in natural health’, during my six years in New York, was the key inspiration to create Karmameju in Copenhagen in 1999. My dream was - and is - to redefine wellness. I am convinced that beautiful skin is achieved through natural health and good skincare routines. Your skin has an innate ability to regenerate when given the right conditions.

The company was founded in 1947 by Eigil Nielsen, the Danish national football team’s goal keeper. In Eigil Nielsen’s days top players could not live solely from their sport so he chose to train as a sports psychologist and also had a job in the shoe and leather industry. Here he created the first SELECT football.

In 1962 SELECT introduced one of the greatest inventions in the history of football - the 32-section ball. At the beginning of the 1970's Eigil Nielsen was again a forerunner when he and SELECT brought out a handball with 32 sections.

All sorts of football and handball tournaments are still played with balls based on Eigil Nielsen’s 32-section principle - just as all the balls produced in the world today are built on his innovation.

SELECT is partner of a long list of federations and clubs in the world of football and handball and is furthermore deeply involved in a number of humanitarian projects around the globe.

Alpha Aqua A/S was founded in 2017 by two well-esteemed Danish companies, each with long track records in the aqua industry. They were determined to gather the best and most innovative technicians, vets and biologists in the international aquaculture industry in order to design and build the next generation of RAS systems for the global market.

A LAND-BASED RECIRCULATING AQUACULTURE SYSTEM FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
Alpha Aqua A/S provides a unique approach to the aquaculture industry: 
•	Turnkey solutions
•	Modular systems/production units developed in phases
•	Faster construction, no fixed concrete structures implying
•	better Return on Investment (ROI)
•	Efficient planning, safer production units, and lower total costs
Producing total solutions within on-shore fish farming, Alpha Aqua A/S has developed a system that ensures that fish farming can take place on land in a recirculating aquaculture system where the water is purified and not replaced to any great extent - this has the potential to disrupt the industry since we have the solution to the environmental challenges that fish farming can entail.

WE SUPPORT THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 
At Alpha Aqua, our mission is to contribute to the development of more sustainable aquaculture production, thus making it possible to utilize the world’s aquacultural resources more effectively. As such we want to help facilitate a change towards consumption of more sustainably produced protein.

To enable us to continue supplying the growing world population with enough protein in the future, fish production will need to rise. In the future of aquaculture, the concept of circular agriculture is essential.
Alpha Aqua uses recyclable food grade PP (polypropylene) for their Water Treatment Units as well as the tanks and production systems.

He took inspiration from it and decided to introduce it in Denmark which is why he brought a pair of Bull Denim-overalls home from 'over there'​. This was the start of one of Denmark’s very first workwear manufacturers.

Subsequently, development speeded up. In 1964, F. Engel entered fashion business. At first, it was a series of men’s trousers called IN-CA, later the brand Easy Line and, in 1990, it was the purchase of the Sunwill brand.

The workwear production has also been developing rapidly with the purchase of the exclusive WorkZone workwear in 1996.

Mr Carl D. Engel’s very big leisure passion, hunting, resulted in 1985 in the founding of the exclusive hunting clothing Deerhunter.

Today, our group is divided in three strong and independent divisions: The workwear division, the men’s clothing division and the hunting & outdoor division. We are 120 employees in Denmark and we manufacture our products in our own dressmaker’s workrooms in Lithuania.

The kitchen offered a radical alternative to the inflexible, heavily crafted kitchens of the time, which allowed neither freedom nor originality in terms of kitchen layout. From the basement of his home in Lyngby, Arne Munch created an entirely new kitchen concept, whose simple ingenious design revolutionised kitchens.

Arne Munch was inspired by the attractive and original cabinet furniture of the time and insisted on incorporating this same elegance and high quality into his kitchen design. With this in mind, he created the uno form kitchen with its characteristic slotted fronts, which have made uno form a genuine Danish design classic and one which has retained its originality for 45 years.

For de otte omkring bordet handler det om to ting: Selvstændighed og økologi.

Navnet på butikken var på dette tidspunkt ikke Eventyrsport men Toursport, og vi havde kun åbnet fra kl. 13 til 17. Men stille og roligt blev åbningstiden udvidet, og inden længe kørte butikken på fuld tid. Derfor tog vi i 1998 et stort skridt, ud af kælderen og ind i en ny og mere professionel butik.

Snart var vi atter på udkig efter mere plads. Men intet virkelig passende dukkede op - indtil en dag ... En smuk butik i det gamle shopping område, kendt som latinerkvarteret, i midten af Århus var blevet ledigt. Denne forretning var det bedste, vi havde set hidtil, men desværre var lokalet ikke meget større end den nuværende Toursport. Og derfor besluttede vi os for at åbne en ny butik med mere fokus på beklædning og fodtøj end tidligere. Navnet på den nye butik blev: ""Eventyrsport""​. 

Navnet er sammensat af ’Eventyr’ og ’sport’. Ordet 'sport'​ understreger et element af at være aktive samtidig med at man nyder sine egne personlige eventyr - rejser, vandreture, skiløb, og har det sjovt. Vi fandt det var et passende navn til en ny outdoor-butik i Danmark. 

I dag har vi 10 butikker - og forhåbentlig er vores eventyr først lige begyndt.

Salget af vin udviklede sig eksplosivt de følgende år og da vinen efterhånden blev den absolut vigtigste del af forretningen, besluttede medlemmerne af Spritlageret Danmark at danne et aktieselskab med navnet Excellent Wine.

1754,1678576,Nupo ApS,"Nupo - ""To make life a positive experience for people while they're on a diet""​

In 1981, the leading Danish obesity researcher Dr. Flemming Quaade
developed a solution that would change the lives of his overweight and
obese patients. A formula to help them lose weight while providing all the
nutrition the body needs.

At the time, dieting generally meant abstaining from certain foods or from
eating altogether. We knew that unhealthy and unbalanced diets negatively
impacted people’s health and psychology, resulting in failed weight loss
attempts and fatigue.

In pursuit of our ambition to set a new standard for weight loss products,
we innovated the Nupo Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD). The VLCD diet
liberated dieting making it healthier for the body with products containing
all the essential vitamins, minerals, proteins and fibers. Once the diet
products were in place, we needed a compass to guide different lifestyles
and diet preferences. The Nupo Brick System was born out of this need.
It removed strictness from dieting, making it flexible to the needs of every
individual. Nupo Brick System liberated the mind from dieting, making it OK
to eat the things that made you happy, as long as you stayed within the
boundaries of your daily brick count. At the time, such adaptability was
unheard of.

Anour is lamps for a unique clientele. We combine traditional Danish materials and methods with new technology and trends to create a lasting, yet unique product.

Arash’s Persian roots and Danish upbringing influence his company’s products and policies. The company name – nour – means ‘light’ in Farsi, and the design of his lamps reflect traditional Danish values of simplicity and sustainability.

Arash claims that the secret to Scandinavian success in the design world can be summed up in two words: “no nonsense”. Rather than incorporating excessive design features into products, the Danes focus on crafting the essentials with quality. 

To Arash, the word ‘simple’ does not mean settling for the ordinary. Arash strives to create or exceed trends, not just follow them. He reveals, “I combine rare materials made by one of the last braziers in Copenhagen with new materials on the market.” This mix of old and new differentiates Anour from competitors in the lighting industry.

Arash defines sustainability as the creation of something that lasts. He says, “I hope to create a product that people cherish enough to restore.” He also hopes his product will become a classic design icon for future Scandinavian designers.

Sustainability also incorporates quality. Arash ensures that each lamp is handcrafted to perfection through his employment of a traditional Danish brazier who has worked with brass, copper and bronze materials for decades. This expert brazier implements the natural colouring processes of browning, oxidising and polishing to ensure the lamps’ quality do not deteriorate over time.

“Having a company is like having a child. You must nurture it and maintain its health so it develops into the best example of you.”

For os er det vigtigt at levere produkter, som er produceret med omtanke for dem, der bygger, dem der bruger og dem, der bor. Vi er den første malingsproducent, som fik sine produkter Svanemærket, og vi kan bryste os af at have både det svenske Astma- og allergimærket, MI-frie og M1-mærkede produkter på hylderne.

Vores fokus på miljø og bæredygtighed er en nødvendighed og noget vi arbejder med hver dag. Maling påvirker miljøet, og vi har et ansvar for at gøre, hvad vi kan for at mindske den påvirkning. Derfor har vi blikket rettet i mod, hvordan vi konstant kan forbedre produkternes miljøpræstationer. Det gør vi bl.a. ved kun at have vandbaserede produkter og ved at have fokus på de emissioner vores produkter afgiver til indeklimaet både under og efter brug. Men den grønne omstilling er ikke noget nyt for os, det har været en del af vores DNA i 25 år. Seneste aktiviteter er brugen af genbrugsplast til vores spande og derudover har vi introduceret de første produkter, der er udviklet med udgangspunkt i massebalance-princippet. Princippet går ud på at udskifte nogle af de fossile råmaterialer i malingen med biobaserede.

Kort sagt: Maling med omtanke.

Beckers er ejet af Tikkurila Danmark, der dækker over flere stærke brands, herunder Tikkurila Master Solution og Tikkurila Industri. Tikkurila Danmark er en del af Tikkurila Group der er en ledende producenter af maling i Norden, Østeuropa og Rusland.

Vi har været her i mange år. Mange læsøboere kan nok ikke huske en tid før os, for vi har været her siden Ruder Konge var knægt. I 1963 besluttede en flok af øens fiskere, at de ville sikre fiskeriet gode afsætningsbetingelser og udvikle en stærk, lokal arbejdsplads – A/S Læsø Fiskeindustri så dagens lys.

Der er løbet meget vand i åen siden, og Læsø Fiskeindustri har nu udviklet sig til en af verdens største eksportører af den efterspurgte delikatesse, jomfruhummer. I dag er Læsø Fiskeindustri en topmoderne fødevareproducent med dygtige og erfarne medarbejdere fordelt på tre danske afdelinger, samt et 100% ejet datterselskab i Peterhead på den skotske østkyst. Selvom vi nu rækker ud over Læsøs grænser, drives Læsø Fiskeindustri stadig forankret i de samme kerneværdier, som vi blev grundlagt ud fra, den gang tilbage i 1960’erne – øen, havet og fiskeriet. Det betyder også, at vi stadig er stærkt tilknyttet til det lokale liv på Læsø, hvor vi ser os selv som en vigtig spiller til at sikre øens beskæftigelse, men også som en vigtig lokal samarbejdspartner for øens øvrige erhverv, ligesom vi gerne støtter nyetablerede fiskere økonomisk, når de skal søsættes som selvstændige. 

Læsø Fiskeindustri ejes af godt 350 aktionærer, der alle har en stærk tilknytning til virksomheden og dens lokalområde, og helt som i 1963, består ejerkredsen primært af fiskere, medarbejdere og læsøboere.

For many years, we have been specialising in developing high-technology stoves with the most modern and advanced combustion principles. We do not compromise with product quality, and we always seek to combine technology and aesthetics with end-consumers’ demand for user-friendliness and attractive prices. More than 400,000 Aduro stoves are installed across Europe.

Aduro and the environment
All our stoves are designed by Danish architects whose principal aim has been to create modern and environmentally friendly stoves. We strive to make it easy to do it right and thereby obtain a clean combustion with minimal CO2- and particle emissions. Among other things, all Aduro stoves have automatic control of air supply, so you can obtain a clean combustion more easily. When firing correctly with wood, an Aduro stove is a CO2 neutral heating source – on average, each stove saves the environment from the emission of 4 tonnes of CO2.

Firing with firewood provides you with renewable energy, as the trees store CO2 while growing. When the trees decompose or are burned, they release the same amount of CO2 again. Meanwhile, Aduro ensures the growth of trees and forests through restoring of forests and sustainable forestry. Aduro invests in large areas of forest, in which we expect an annual sustainable growth of wood corresponding to the consumption in approx. 10,000 Aduro stoves. 

In June 2018, Aduro was awarded with the prestigious European Business Award for the Environment on a national level. The award was given for the innovative and sustainable product Aduro Hybrid in the category “Sustainable products and services”. The European Business Awards for the Environment pays tribute to the most environmentally conscious companies in Europe, thus aiming to promote innovative and sustainable initiatives.",Consumer Goods,11-50 employees,2022-03-18T09:50:43.470Z,False

We source coffee directly from the farmer for two main reasons. To guarantee we get the best green beans, and to make sure the farmer is rewarded for the high quality coffee. It is actually quite simple. For the farmer to continue to produce specialty coffee, he or she should be paid extra for the hard work.

In our opinion, sustainability in coffee starts with financial sustainability for the farmers. To make a difference, we believe that we have to start with ourselves by making coffee experiences that contributes to this development.

Vin på fustage er en miljøvenlig tilgang til salg af vin.
Hver fustage sparer 32 vinflasker samt alt tilhørende emballage. Dette reducerer mængden af affald, og det betyder en stor pladsbesparelse ved transport.

Vores fustager garanterer høj kvalitet ved håndtering og præservering af vin fra første til sidste glas.
Den indvendige integrerede pose indeholder vinen, der dermed ingen kontakt får med luften. En yderst kompakt kompressor, pumper luft mellem fustage og pose, hvilket får vinen til at løbe – derfor ingen omkostninger til kulsyreflasker. Fustagen kræver en standard s-kobling og indeholder 24L vin, der har en holdbarhed på 12 måneder efter levering og 1½ måned efter tilslutning.

Hver palle vi fragter hjem indeholder dobbelt så meget vin, som en palle med flasker. Dette betyder færre fragtforsendelser, hvilket reducerer CO2 udledningen fra lastbilstransport.

Vores engangsfustager skal ikke returneres og rengøres, hvilket medfører mindre CO2 udledning og udelukker brug af kemisk vaskemiddel i modsætning til metalfustager.

My Home lagersalgskonceptet startede med lagersalg af møbler og brugskunst fra en privat adresse i Randers. Det viste sig hurtigt, at lagersalgskonceptet var interessant for kunder i området. Derfor blev der i 2006 åbnet en My Home Lagersalg butik i bydelen Kristrup i Randers. Der viste sig hurtigt at blive behov for mere lagerplads, og med mange kunder kom også behovet for mere butiksareal, så forretningen i Randers blev flyttet til en kombineret lager og butik på adressen Nikkelvej 4 i Randers.


Herefter åbnede flere My Home Lagersalg butikker rundt i landet. Der kom igen behov for mere lagerplads, og i efteråret 2009 blev lageret flyttet til Sdr. Borup ved Randers, og siden er der udvidet flere gange, med endnu større lager. Hovedkontoret samt lager har nu adresse i Fårup ved Randers. I dag er My Home landsdækkende med butikker i hele landet.

Vi har lave priser pga. lav husleje, billig indretning, lav bemanding og fordi vi køber hovedparten af vores møbler direkte, uden mellemled, ved leverandører i asien og hele europa.

We are taking care of already produced surplus goods and selling it online at affordable prices to customers who want to buy perfectly good food that otherwise would have gone to waste. 

Join our revolution!

***Background***
The problem with food waste is huge, and a third of all food produced in the world is thrown away.

Motatos was founded by a team of three passionate entrepreneurs in 2013, who had come up with a simple solution to this problem.

Today, we are one of the fastest growing companies in the Nordics, present in three markets and with 400 MSEK in run rate revenue. Backed by well-known investors we have very ambitious and exciting growth plans ahead. Our superstar team consists of 30-something bright minds in the Stockholm HQ office, 100+ super stars in the warehouse in Katrineholm, and now establishing a local dream team in Copenhagen. Join us and become a part of the food waste revolution!

1978,22346779,Sjölin,"FASHION TRENDS CHANGES, BUT OUR DEDICATION TO CONSTANTLY PERFECTING OUR TAILOR-MADE SUITS NEVER WILL. 

Sjölin is, according to online rankings, the best notified firm within the category of tailor-made suits in the Nordics. We are confident that our unapologetic dedication to constantly perfecting our tailor-made suits and customer experience is the single most important factor driving our rankings upwards. 

Sjölin was established in 2013 with an ambition to challenge the current way of acquiring a suit. But why? During his career as an accountant the founder, Patrick Pedersen, experienced that well-tailored high-quality suits are very costly and the reason is not simply huge production cost but in fact, the intermediaries between the producer and retailer that all charge a fee from pushing the products closer to the buyer. In many corporations, especially within the Audit, Legal and Consulting industry, employees experience that wearing a suit on an everyday basis is most often not only encouraged but strictly enforced by formal Dress-Code policies. Up until now, acquiring a sufficient amount of work suits has been expensive. 

Luckily, Sjölin has managed to cut out all intermediaries thus making the traditional retail model much leaner and securing a great consumer price reduction. For that reason, we can at all times offer you our high-quality tailor-made suits made based on 27 individual measurement and in a quality corresponding to well-known brands at very low prices.

We produce to amaze.

I et nedlagt autoværksted i København dyrker vi dild, koriander, fennikel, tallerkensmækker og andet mikrogrønt, som vi leverer til en kundekreds bestående af lokale restauranter og kantiner. 

Vores kunder er både kvalitets- og miljøbevidste. De kan se værdien i at modtage deres bestilling, senest to timer efter den er høstet. Hverken smag eller næringsværdi går tabt under leveringen, som selvfølgelig foregår med cykelbud. Sådan trækker vi i fællesskab fødevareindustrien i en sundere og mere bæredygtig retning. Det er det, vi forstår ved godt naboskab. 

Afgrøderne er naturligvis fri for sprøjtegift og genmodifikationer. Deres næringskilder er en nøje udvalgt sammensætning af ilt, mineraler, varme, vand og god musik.

Tilsammen har vi mere end 15 år i tech-branchen på bagen. Den erfaring har vi brugt til at udvikle en software, som kan styre planternes omgivelser ned til mindste detalje. Resultatet er sundt og velsmagende bladgrønt. Det synes vi alle har ret til, ligesom enhver by har ret til en Nabo Farm.",Food Production,1-10 employees,2022-03-18T09:50:53.070Z,False

Vi vælger omhyggeligt vores råvarer, og vi plejer det gode bryggerhåndværk.

Kærligheden til råvarerne og håndværket er gået i arv fra generation til generation, og derfor er det i dag grundlæggeren Søren Christian Fuglsangs tipoldebørn, der driver familiens bryggeri – som i øvrigt er Danmarks ældste familieejede bryggeri.

Familien driver også sin egen eksportmaltfabrik, som er en af de få uafhængige i Europa – og det er selvfølgelig den, der leverer det meste af den gode malt til Fuglsangs øl. Derudover vælger brygmesteren at give nogle øltypers fyldige maltsmag lidt kant, idet han tilfører udvalgte humlesorter fra f.eks. USA, England eller Tyskland.

Fuglsang koncernens vokseværk har betydet, at Danmarks ældste mineralvandsfabrik, Frem, er blevet en del af Bryggeriet Fuglsang. Frem producerer forsat sine signatur retro-sodavand og saft på kvartvandsflasker.

We made a concept that could stretch the durability, stretch the affordability, and more than anything, stretch the opportunities of storage furniture.

We use sturdy materials and turn them into light and stylish solutions that last a lifetime yet can be de-constructed and re-constructed if your storage needs or design preferences change. RackBuddy is your partner for life.

Vi garanterer, at en din blomsterhilsen eller vingave når frem til tiden - det kræver blot nogle få klik på www.interflora.dk så er din hilsen på vej - selv på tværs af landegrænser.

Historien om Interflora
En genial ide fødes i Berlin….. Året er 1907, da den Berlinske blomsterhandler Max Hübner skaber ideen ""Sig det med blomster""​ og dermed lægger grundstenen til vore dages Interflora.

Max Hübner begyndte at etablere private aftaler med andre blomsterhandlere i Berlin for at kunne modtage bestillinger i sin butik i midten af byen og få dem leveret gennem en kollega nærmere leveringsstedet. Ideen var enkel, men Max Hübner så mulighederne, og med imponerende indsats fik han i løbet af få år skabt et netværk af blomsterhandlere i hele Tyskland - og Max Hübner fortsatte arbejdet med at skabe kontakter over hele jorden.

Idéen kommer til Danmark
I 1919 stifter den driftige blomsterhandler Carl Jørgensen fra Vesterbrogade på rejser i Tyskland bekendtskab med blomsterformidling på tværs af de tyske byer. Carl Jørgensen ser straks mulighederne for en lignende ordning i den danske blomsterbranche.

I løbet af de følgende 6 år byggede han sit eget netværk op blandt danske blomsterhandlere. Netværket blev så omfattende at Carl Jørgensen i 1925 mødtes med en række blomsterhandlere i Odense, som førte til dannelsen af foreningen ""Ekspreslevering af Blomster""​ – E.B. – hvor Carl Jørgensen naturligvis beklædte formandsposten i foreningens første år. Den nye forening var organisatorisk underlagt Dansk Blomsterhandlerforening, som hermed stod til det helt store gennembrud som en faglig landsforening for de danske blomsterhandlere.

Verdensorganisationen INTERFLORA stiftes i København
Efter Anden Verdenskrig blev det internationale samarbejde om blomsterformidling på tværs af landegrænser genoptaget, og ved en verdenskongres i København i juli 1946 stiftes INTERFLORA.",Retail,201-500 employees,2022-03-18T09:51:07.540Z,True

Having said that, we created Stocko, b2b textile marketplace with the most structured fabrics database, where we are uniting all the fabric suppliers and buyers of the world. Our goal is to fully digitize the textile industry by the end of 2021 by bringing all the manufacturers and sellers of fabric stock globally into our platform and connecting them with fabric buyers to create one digital textile ecosystem.

2087,29333804,PFP A/S,"PFP A/S er Skandinaviens ældste og mest erfarne leverandør af bordpladeskrædderi til køkken, bad og øvrige industrier med særlige krav og behov. Selskabet blev stiftet i 1953, og siden starten har god kvalitet, høj faglighed og innovation været omdrejningspunktet for virksomhedens aktiviteter. Bl.a. derfor har PFP igennem mange år været kendt som ""Den danske bordpladespecialist""​. Det er et renommé vi er stolte af, og en ”titel” vi dagligt forsøger at gøres os fortjent til.

PFP står for Post Forming Production – en teknik udviklet i virksomheden, hvor man bukker laminat over en afrundet kant af spånplade. Laminatproduktion var således virksomhedens udgangspunkt, og PFP er fortsat en af Europa´s førende og mest alsidige producenter af specialløsninger i laminat.

I dag er PFP A/S specialiseret i at producere og sælge skræddersyede bordplader i laminat, massivtræ, Dupont™ Corian®, kompaktlaminat, granit, kompositsten, Ceramic, FormaCor, glas og stål. Langt de fleste bordpladeløsninger leveres idag med monterede vaske. Også her var PFP den første til at introducerer dette i laminat, og blandt de første og mest innovative på flere af virksomhedens andre produktkategorier.

Hos PFP har vi stor fokus på detaljen i håndværket. Uanset hvilket materiale vi arbejder med, stræber vi altid efter at levere kundetilpassede bordplader på højeste kvalitets niveau. Vi går ikke på kompromis. Køkkenet er det rum i hjemmet hvor vi tilbringer de fleste vågne timer. Bordpladen er det der giver køkkenet eller spisebordet sin identitet, og samtidig er det den overflade hvor der arbejdes og slides mest i huset. Derfor er bordpladen en af de vigtigste elementer i et hjemmet, og således også en af de vigtigste og sværeste beslutninger for boligindretningen. Derfor sætter vi en ære i at gøre beslutningen lidt lettere, løsningen lidt anderledes og bordpladen meget bedre for vores kunder og deres kunder.",Furniture,51-200 employees,2022-03-18T09:51:07.541Z,False

Sunwill har rødder tilbage til 1963, hvor virksomheden første gang lancerede moderigtige bukser til kræsne og krævende mænd, der hverken ville gå på kompromis med pasform eller kvalitet. I 1989 overtog den familieejede virksomhed F. Engel konfektionsvirksomheden Sunwill, som i årenes løb var blevet kendt og elsket for at designe og producere unikke herrebukser.

I dag ligger ansvaret for at videreføre og videreudvikle den traditionsrige virksomhed for herremode hos direktør John C. Engel.

Høj kvalitet, lang holdbarhed og perfekt pasform 

Sunwill har i mange år været kendt som buksespecialist og har udvidet brandet, så sortimentet i dag også omfatter konfektionerede habitter, blazere og veste. Corporate wear er endnu en vigtig gren af Sunwill, og er i dag blevet en fast del af virksomhedens koncept.

Udviklingen har kun været mulig, fordi vi hele tiden har fastholdt kerneværdierne: høj kvalitet, lang holdbarhed og pasform ned i mindste detalje – værdier, som vi sætter en stor ære i. Vi producerer ikke bare tøj i metermål uden tanke på anvendeligheden. Vi gør os umage og konfektionerer tøj med 100% fokus på den perfekte pasform.

John C. Engels farfar grundlagde, sammen med sin bror Jacob J. Engel og deres far Friedrich Engel, virksomheden F. Engel i 1927.
Virksomheden producerede arbejdstøj i det nye og slidstærke stof denim. John er derfor 4. generation tøjmand og nærmest født ind i tekstilbranchen, som han elsker.

Vores mål er at få folk til at forbruge tekstiler bedre, sådan at vi kan gå fra et overforbrug til et forbrug, Herefter kan vi begynde at se på hvordan forbruget bliver bæredygtigt.

Som tekstiltrykkeri er vi specielt gode til t-shirts, og laver som oftest samarbejder med organisationer, foreninger og større firmaer.  Der ud over så plejer vi at sige at vi laver tryk på alt andet end papir, så som Bannere, klistermærker, kopper, fliser, roll ups osv. osv. osv.

2161,5240079,A.C. Perch's Thehandel Aps,"The gennem 7 generationer.

I sidste halvdel af 1700 tallet blomstrede både handelen og velstanden på Christianshavn. Dette skyldtes ikke kun, at det Asiatiske Kompagni havde til huse her, men derimod også at de mange skibe der bragte varer fra det fjerne Østen, lagde til ved kajen. Kompagniet var dog ikke det eneste, der solgte de hjembragte varer på sine aktioner. Mange andre købmænd etablerede sig i nærheden, og de fik varer fra Kompagniet samt fra de kaptajner der havde dispositionsretten over en del af skibenes last. Blandt de mest ansete af disse købmænd var Jens Bay Perch, som støttet af sin gode ven Niels Brock, startede sin virksomhed på Christianshavn.

Hans søn blev opkaldt efter vennen og kom til at hedde Niels Brock Perch, grundlæggeren af det gamle Thehus. Niels Brock Perch´s første butik havde til huse under Børsen, hvor Danmarks første ""supermarked""​ så dagens lys. Det var nemlig her, at man for første gang indrettede små butikker side om side under samme tag.

I April 1835 åbnede Niels Brock Perch så sin lille butik i Kronprinsensgade 5 , hvor theforretningen stadig har til huse, i samme interiør, der i løbet af de sidste 5 år har undergået en gennemgribende restaurering. Forretningen er udover det elektriske lys og ""nyere""​ personale fuldstændig intakt. Slægten Perch fører Thehuset videre helt frem til 1894, hvor familien Hincheldey overtager. Det er i dag 4. generation af slægten Hincheldey, der har den daglige ledelse. A.C. Perchs Thehandel er Kongelig HofIeverandør og har de sidste 100 år været et familiefirma, hvor der ofte har været tre genrationer bag disken.

Den personlige kontakt og en seriøs faglig betjening har altid været forretningens højeste mål.  A.C. Perch's Thehandel kan i dag glæde sig over at have betjent syv generationer i årene 1835 til 2014.",Food & Beverages,51-200 employees,2022-03-18T09:51:22.546Z,True

Den henter vi dagligt fra sunde køer, der trives på vores egne gårde. Resten handler om at være omhyggelig med håndværket. Som et lille andelsmejeri arbejder vi tæt sammen om at gøre det hele så godt, vi kan – med det fælles mål at lave oste, der ikke fås bedre. Og da vi ikke er et stort mejeri, er der aldrig langt fra tanke til handling. Virke- og udviklingslysten er stor på Them Andelsmejeri. Sammen tror vi på værdien af god gammeldags omhu og at gøre sit ypperste hele vejen fra arbejdet med dyrene, til ostene leveres til butikkerne. 

Vi er 13 landmænd, som ejer mejeriet, og alle vores gårde ligger i det smukke jyske søhøjland inden for en radius af 25 kilometer fra mejeriet. Seks af gårdene er økologiske, og vi er alle landmænd, som ved, hvordan vi får dyrene til at trives. Vi tager dyrevelfærd, bæredygtighed og klimaudfordringerne alvorligt. Derfor er vi blandt andet også ved at søsætte en klimahandlingsplan for både mejeriet og gårdene. Vi producerer både gule oste (Danbo) og en lang række special- og premium-oste – og mange af dem udvikler vi med vores helt egne unikke ostekulturer. Af vores mest kendte oste kan nævnes; Fætter Kras, Rød Krystal, Gudenå Gylden og Gran.

It all boils down to a deep and complex flavour. Every drop has a high quality. Each batch has its own personality. Season, soil and soul decide. Enjoy the mystery. Enjoy with care. It's your nature. Distilled. 

Behind every excellent and original idea stands a curious mind. In the case of the gin developed and distilled by Njord, it is actually two curious minds belonging to the friends, Lars Toke and Troels. A keen fondness of gin turned from hobby to a full-time passion in 2014. Ever since, they have been dedicated to crafting distinct avantgarde gin of the highest quality at Denmark’s only distillery devoted to gin.

The gins created by Njord are a reflection of nature. That is the mission behind each and every bottle. Njord goes beyond the simplistic flavour profiles traditionally consisting of juniper berries, coriander seeds and few other botanicals. Instead they create unique complex gins rooted in Danish nature. Njord is aiming to distill the most interesting gins possible by focusing on using complex distillates and hand-picked botanicals. That is why their gins are appreciated at the best restaurants and cocktail bars, loved by 
people who desire new taste experiences and why Njord is internationally renowned and awarded.

En Lacuna foldedør er alternativet til den almindelig hæve-, skydedør, blot med en meget større åbning og fleksibilitet.

Generelt:

En facade foldedør er mere avanceret end almindelige vinduer og døre. Materialevalget er afgørende for et resultat, der holder og fungerer under alle vejrforhold år efter år. 
Andre vigtige faktorer er tæthed, indbrudssikkerhed og isoleringsevne. 

Dokumentation for tæthed, indbrudssikkerhed og isoleringsevne er vigtigt. Her er den mest troværdige dokumentation fra Dansk Teknologisk Institut.

Sandsynligvis verdens bedste!

Med en Lacuna Foldedør får du ikke den billigste foldedør på markedet. Til gengæld får du verdens sandsynligvis bedste foldedør.

Fremstillet i FSC-certificeret hårdttræ, der ikke arbejder. Derfor åbner og lukker døren perfekt under alle vejrforhold. Af samme grund producerer vi ikke foldedøre baseret på fyrretræ herunder træ/alu, da denne løsning ikke lever op til Lacuna’s standarder for dimensionsstabilitet, funktionalitet og holdbarhed. 

Malet i mange lag, hvilket medfører en unik holdbarhed. Det vil under normale forhold ikke være nødvendigt at vedligeholde med maling de første 20 år. 

Certificeret i.h.t. den Europæiske indbrudsstandard EN 1628/ 29 D.v.s. stor sikkerhed mod indbrud. 
Blandt andet er der ingen udvendige glaslister, der kan brækkes op, så glasset kan tages ud. 

Tæthedstestet til mere end 1200  Pa, svarende til en vindstyrke på mere end 65 sekund/meter.  Den optimale tæthed skyldes blandt andet, at foldedøren har dobbelte og tredobbelte tætningslister. Det sikrer samtidig høj isolations effekt omkring døren.

Der ydes, som den eneste foldedør, 10 års garanti på fabrikations og materialefejl.",Building Materials,11-50 employees,2022-03-18T09:51:41.338Z,False

2269,28632658,H. Skjalm P.,"H. Skjalm P. blev etableret som detailbutik i de historiske omgivelser på Nikolaj Plads i 1953 af Hagbarth Skjalm Petersen og hans hustru Lisbeth Westergaard.

Hagbarth Skjalm Petersen var et “enfant terrible”, der altid ønskede at gå sine egne veje. Det var i H. Skjalm P., at designbevidste københavnere kom, når de ville se på og anskaffe sig de seneste nyheder inden for boligtekstiler, brugskunst og køkkenredskaber. Skjalm´s holdning var, at der i produktudviklingen skulle være en “rød tråd” samtidig med, at der til stadighed skulle forkuseres på nyskabelse udover det sædvanlige. Han var således altid en af de første, der introducerede nye farver, former og grafiske udtryk. 

I begyndelsen af 80’erne, begyndte firmaet at importere store mængder af designvarer fra England og det var starten på et voksende en gros salg. Sidenhen har det udviklet sig til et anerkendt design-brand, som præsenterer en ny kollektion hvert halve år, med udgangspunkt i stifteren af firmaets filosofi om nyskabende designs baseret på naturmaterialer i god kvalitet og med et skandinavisk look.",Retail,11-50 employees,2022-03-18T09:51:50.978Z,True

2303,11450467,Toft Care A/S,"Vores virksomhed bygger på fire meget vigtige grundsten: innovation, nærvær, fleksibilitet & kvalitet. 

Innovation er en hjørnesten i virksomhedens strategi og har altid været det, siden virksomheden tog sin spæde opstart i 1947 med etablering af Axel Toft A/S. Med innovation som udgangspunkt har man kunne konkurrere med store multinationale selskaber om at levere den bedste løsning indenfor ernæring. Innovationstankegangen tvinger hele tiden nye tanker og idéer frem, og det er det materiale, der bærer udviklingen i Toft Care.

I alt hvad vi gør er nærvær væsentligt, og det har det altid været. Ser man tre generationer tilbage i virksomhedens historie, var den daglige kontakt til f.eks. lokale landmænd en vigtig del af virksomhedens nærvær, da disse var virksomhedens grundlag. I dag forsøger vi at udnytte teknologiens muligheder for at skabe nærvær via f.eks. sociale medier. Her kan vi både skabe og holde kontakt samt udvikle nye produkter, få hurtigt feedback og ikke mindst øge serviceniveauet. Selve nærværet kommer til udtryk gennem både sociale medier og igennem direkte menneskelig kontakt. 

Selvom vi vokser os større med tiden, er det vigtigt for os, at du opfatter os som en fleksibelpartner. Vores fleksibilitet kommer til udtryk ved altid at være lydhør overfor ønsker og kritik og samtidig forsøge at være en aktiv sparringspartner indenfor ernæring og udvikling af retter med proteiner, kulhydrater, fedt, fiber, vitaminer og mineraler. 

Vi har en klar holdning til kvalitet og sporbarhed, hvilket kommer til udtryk i vores opmærksomhed på at efterkomme gældende lovgivning og kvalitetskontrol. Vi værner meget om vores Elitesmiley, da den er et udtryk for førnævnte.

organic vegetables and organic eggs in Scandinavia. Focusing on the soil, the plants and animal welfare, Axel Månsson has been producing vegetables and eggs for more than 40 years. Axel Månsson has an eye for tomorrow’s needs, and the company is constantly evolving. The range is expanding in line with product demand.

New products will typically arise from the local development and demonstration areas on the farm, where many new species and varieties are tested and produced each year.
Samples and smaller lots are shipped to customers for testing, and it is ensured whether it’s possible to produce the relevant product organically, on Brande’s light soil. New emerging organic products include: Fresh herbs and edible flowers, new types of cabbages and new specialty lettuces, as well as more exotic species.

Convenience products, such as whole peeled onions, have been part of the range for many years, and this segment is still being developed – first and foremost as peeled onions diced or cut into rings. All products come in a variety of packages and in both organic and conventional variants.

The farm is wellknown for being open to the public. Guided tours, lectures and workshops etc. are available upon request. A former hen house is converted into a well-stocked organic farm shop, and an organic farm café is on its way. 

Sustainable production
Axel Månsson has a vision to become self-sufficient of nutrients in order to fulfill the organic cycle. An organic biogas plant converts different biomasses to natural gas, for heating appr. 12,000 households. The degassed biomass is used as valuable fertilizer for the vegetables. The latest technology is used in e.g. weed control and packaging. Sustainability is in focus in all aspects of the production. Monitoring and analysis is continously used in the production to ensure efficient utilization of the resources supplied, as well as full 
traceability.

Grejsdal. Gården er en gammel selvstændig mølleejendom, hvorpå der igennem næsten 600 år 
har været mølleri. Her har bønderne fået malet deres korn til mel og gryn, og ved stampeværket
blev der lavet klæde til dyner, kørekapper, mandstøj, drengetøj og kjoletøj i den kvalitet, 
skrædderen ønskede det. I 1860 grundlagdes flormelsmølleriet, som blev ved til 1925. I 1921 oprettedes
et elektricitetsværk, som ved hjælp af vandkraften leverede strøm til hele Hover sogn.
 
Ved møllen var der også et savværk – og her blev der under krigen lavet fiskekasser og savet 
generatorbrænde.
 
Hopballe Mølle er en gammel slægtsgård, som har været i familiens eje siden 1807 – hele tiden
gået i arv fra far til søn. Den nuværende ejer er således 6. generation. Der har altid været tradition
for dyrehold på stedet, før i tiden var det heste, køer, får, grise, gæs, ænder, høns og kyllinger. 
I dag driver 6. generation Hopballe Mølle som landbrug med planteavl og kyllingeproduktion - og 
7. generation hjælper til!. Vi ønsker at sætte fokus på dyrevelfærd og den gode råvare og vil derfor 
tilbyde kvalitetskød direkte solgt fra gården uden fordyrende mellemled.

Vi har produceret kyllinger i mere end 20 år og den erfaring bruger vi selvfølgelig i vores arbejde 
– kyllingerne trives og har masser af plads til at røre sig på - det kan ses og smages på kødet.

Kødet har mere struktur, smag og kraft. Kødet er gyldent og mørt på grund af majsen.

På vores skønne beliggenhed har vi en restaurant hvor vi bl.a serverer vores lækre Hopballekyllinger tilberedt på flere forskellige måder og du kan indtage maden i de dejligste omgivelser på terrasserne ud til søen.

Eve is unlike any other robot, due to our Revo1 drive system with in-house developed motors and close to frictionless transmissions. This enables her to be the world’s first human strength direct drive robot, she operates silently and can safely interact with people. We have already set the world records for highest torque to weight ratio servo motors, most transparent transmissions and highest payload to weight ratio for a robotic arm, and we have barely started.

After developing our prototype robot, and successfully securing funding, we are preparing to scale up our organization to further develop our robot and handle production. 

Eve has been developed from the ground up to be mass produced at low cost and to handle the latency inherent in cloud computing. This will enable her to utilize modern artificial intelligence approaches for both reasoning and dynamics, and be affordable for domestic use given sufficient volumes.

Eve is a general purpose full size humanoid robot, capable of a wide variety of tasks. She will start mainly in the industrial and healthcare segments, where our high payload fully equipped wheeled platform with vision, arms, hands, hips and ankles will enable a lot of uses that are not cost effective today. As her intelligence develops she will gradually move towards the domestic consumer market.

Helt fra oppstarten i 1998 har Stormberg vært opptatt av å ta et aktivt samfunnsansvar. 25 % av alle som rekrutteres er personer som normalt havner utenfor arbeidslivet, og Stormberg var den første sports- og tekstilgrossisten som ble tatt opp i Initiativ for etisk handel i 2002. I Stormberg jobber vi kontinuerlig med å redusere klima- og miljøbelastningen og 1% av omsetningen går til humanitære og samfunnsnyttige formål. 

De fleste av oss som jobber i Stormberg har en ting til felles - vi liker å være ute på små og store turer, fordi vi føler at naturopplevelser gir mye.

Før Stormberg kom på markedet, forundret det oss at godt sports- og turtøy måtte koste så mye. Kjøpte du dette, fikk du riktignok klær du kunne dra på ekspedisjon til Sydpolen i. Men vi skulle ikke dit. Vi ville bare ut på tur med venner eller familie, og ofte var det ikke lenger enn til et skogholt eller en strand rett i nærheten.

Det fantes noen billige merker, men de manglet praktiske løsninger og vi stolte ikke på at de ville gjøre nytten hvis det ble virkelig dårlig vær. Vi var sikre på at vi ikke var de eneste som savnet et alternativ til det dyre sports- og turtøyet. Derfor etablerte vi Stormberg i februar 1998, for å lage sports- og turtøy som skulle fungere godt, se bra ut og ha en fornuftig pris. Vi ville gjøre det lettere for hele familien å komme seg ut på tur. Steinar J. Olsen er Stormbergs gründer, og mannen som ga liv til konseptet.

Siden 1998 har vi hatt en god vekst i omsetning og antall medarbeidere, og den fantastiske mottakelsen Stormberg har fått over hele landet, viser at nordmenn ønsker funksjonelt sports- og turtøy til familievennlige priser.

Jørgen and Erik had been competing in the same ski club in Oslo and done some travelling together in Patagonia. Erik welcomed the challenge and together they founded Amundsen Sports out of Oslo Norway in 2009.

The very foundations of Amundsen Sports, are made of the standards set by Roald Amundsen and his spirit of adventure. His successful combination of tradition with innovation strongly inspire us on our mission to enhance and simplify the everyday life for outdoor enthusiasts. We develop smart products inspired by the past and built for the future with advanced technical features and state-of-the-art materials.

Takket være Leca-blokka kunne en helt vanlig familie med normal inntekt skaffe seg sin egen enebolig uten noe særlig egenkapital. Egeninnsatsen ved bygging av grunnmuren var tilstrekkelig som egenkapital for Den Norske Husbank da Norge skulle gjenoppbygges etter krigen og langt inn i 70-årene.

I dag består Leca-sortimentet i tillegg til et stort utvalg Leca blokker også av piper og vegg- og gulv-elementer. Men Leca-kula selv er også et viktig produkt. Den er velkjent for sin bruk i blomsterpotter og blomsterbed, men det virkelig store bruksområdet er til fyllmasse, drenering og isolasjon på områder som bygg, vei og bane.

Siden 1954 har det skjedd en rekke omorganiseringer og eierskifter, og i dag er Leca en del av det franske selskapet Saint-Gobain, som bl.a. driver Leca-virksomhet i 12 europeiske land. Saint-Gobain er et veletablert internasjonalt konsern med 350 års historie og rundt 190.000 ansatte i over 60 land.

In 2016, Kistefos AS joined as owners, and significant investments were made in new infrastructure at the facility in Tømmervåg. This is now a highly modern and top quality facility. It has had full production of lumpfish since 2017.

In the first half of 2019, Lumarine acquired two companies: Njord Salmon AS in Tjeldbergodden and Atlantic Lumpus AS at Sleneset in Nordland. These companies are now named Lumarine Tjeldbergodden and Lumarine Sleneset.

Since acquiring Njord Salmon in 2019, Lumarine has been working on plans to exploit existing capacity and to develop activities at Bioparken. Residual heat from Equinor makes makes Bioparken a very energy efficient location for warm water aquaculture.

By signing partnership agreements with Mowi for ballan wrasse and Gadus for cod, Lumarine has successfully developed predictable production, based on existing capacity that will last throughout 2024.

The two contracts provide solid foundations for further development of this location. The cod industry is witnessing significant growth, despite being in an early stage of development. Young fish capacity is a bottleneck for cod farmers in their current efforts to scale up from trial activities to commercial volumes. Lumarine aims to take a leading role for the industry by providing young fish capacity at Tjeldbergodden, to meet the industry's needs.

Vi i Dyrket.no jobber for å gi deg de beste, reneste og ferskeste matvarene fra lokale produsenter i området der du bor. Vi leverer mat direkte fra bonden og produsentene til bordet, slik at reisetiden mellom åkeren og kjøkkenbenk blir så kort og skånsom som mulig.

2) Klikk for å høste

I dag blir de små produsentene og butikkene enten utkonkurrert av masseprodusert mat, eller sitter igjen med brøkdelen av salgsprisen i butikkhyllen. Vi mener at de som jobber med grønnsakene i åkeren, som avler kyllingene eller trekker fisken, skal sitte igjen med overskuddet.

Det gjør vi ved å kutte ut alle fordyrende mellomledd, slik at 75% av det du betaler for råvarene går rett til menneskene som lever og ånder for å produsere god mat.

3) Bærekraft i fokus

Vi i Dyrket tror at de små produsentene som driver landbruk etter økologiske, biodynamiske prinsipper betyr en sunn hverdag i dag, et variert landbruk i fremtiden og renest smak i råvarene.

Derfor bruker vi så langt det er mulig produsenter som velger å drive bærekraftig og tar vare på jorda, vannet og luften vi puster.

The story of Lett

In October 2014, Knut Andreas Berg and Sebastian Wahl opened the very first Lett restaurant in Klingenberggata 7 in Oslo. With a background in finance and real estate, respectively, the two food enthusiasts wanted to make it easier for people to choose healthy and nutritious food.

Easy fresh salads and wraps fell in good taste with hungry Oslo residents. It did not take long before there where several departments in the capital, and the green message eventually spread all the way to Sweden: Our first restaurant in Stockholm opened in November 2017.

Working in line with the environment has always been an important part of Letts DNA. In collaboration with Klimato, we calculate the climate footprint of the dishes to ensure that everyone is below the UN target of 0.5 kg CO2-e. We get good, short-distance veggies delivered directly to the door by local farmers. All disposable packaging with us is made of plants, and the long-term goal is reuse. In 2019, we also established an internal climate committee, which analyzes operations and ensures that we make smart, green choices on the way to becoming a climate-positive player.

In 2019, Lett served over 400,000 tasty meals from our 10 departments in Oslo and Stockholm. And we are growing. With a dedicated group of cheerful people with ambitions and determination, 20 new restaurants will be established in the coming years. The goal is the same today as in the beginning: It should be easy to make green, good choices for both health and the environment. It should be easy to eat right.",Food & Beverages,51-200 employees,2022-03-18T10:04:04.204Z,False

BORA COOKTOP EXTRACTOR
A revolution in the kitchen

BORA cooktop extractor draws steam directly down from the cooktop and is:

- The most efficient extractor lets you cook without odor
- The quietest kitchen fan on the market
- Extremely energy-saving
- Easier to clean – put all the parts into the dishwasher
- Exclusive and award winning design
- Made in solid and stainless materials
- Designed for the trendy and modern kitchen - flexible space usage and location of the cooking range
- Free view and open conversation in a dynamic and social kitchen

BORA nips cooking vapors and odors in the bud by drawing them off where they arise: directly at the cooktop, from the saucepan, roaster, frying pan or grill. And we do this not by magic, but by applying the basic principles of fluid mechanics. We simply use a cross flow which is greater than the rising speed of the cooking vapor.

As a result, steam, vapors and heat disappear immediately, so that you and your pots are surrounded by fresh and clean air. No more food smelling hair, clothes or kitchens.",Consumer Goods,11-50 employees,2022-03-18T10:04:13.116Z,False

Open, transparent and answerable to the next generation, we put sustainability at the heart of everything we do. We are passionate about offering premium fish products – today and tomorrow – and we promise full traceability from harbor to home.

Babord is headquartered in Måløy, a fishing community on the island of Vågsøy, just off Norway’s rugged coast. For generations, the traditional boats of Vågsøy have put out to sea, bearing west past the distinctive Kannesteinen rock to the fishing grounds of the North Atlantic. Then days later, often many days later, the boats laden with the catch would return home, guided by the lighthouse at Kråkenes to the safety of the harbour once more.

Today, Babord is proud of this heritage and this island home, and the islanders remain passionate about the continued success of the business. They are boat builders and fishing people raised with the open sea as both their neighbour and provider.

In return, Babord cares for the local community and seeks to create prosperity for the town, its people and the region. Indeed, our mission is to develop solid and sustainable companies that help to benefit ALL the communities in which we operate. We believe our presence should always make a difference.

Kolonihagen har i dag matkasser, nettbutikk, restaurant, bakeri, bryggeri og selger produkter i Rema 1000. For mer informasjon gå inn på www.kolonihagen.no

Vår filosofi:

Kort fortalt, økologisk frukt og grønnsaker har høyere næringsnivå med blant annet mer antioksidanter. Du får mindre rester av tungmetaller, og du unngår rester av kjemiske sprøytemidler. Ifølge et stort studie I Newcastle i England har de økologiske produktene opptil 69 % høyere innhold av viktige antioksidanter enn det som er konvensjonelt dyrket.

Om det er akkurat 69 % som er riktig kan nok de lærde strides om, men vi vet at vi generelt sett kan si at økologisk dyrkede produkter inneholder mer antioksidanter fordi de vokser saktere og derfor må kjempe mer for å overleve.

De inneholder også generelt færre giftstoffer, og er derfor også snillere mot miljøet. Tungmetaller ble også målt i studiet i Newcastle og her fant de at f.eks. innholdet av kadmium, som kan føre til en rekke alvorlige sykdommer som kreft, nesten var 50 prosent lavere i økologiske grønnsaker. Det betyr at å velge mat produsert på en økologisk måte kan føre til økt inntak av ernæringsmessig gunstige antioksidanter og lavere eksponering for giftige tungmetaller.

Det er vanskelig å si at et økologisk kosthold helt sikkert har en helsemessig fordel, men det virker logisk når vi vet at flere av antioksidantene i frukt og grønt har vært koblet til lavere risiko for kreft og andre sykdommer. Det er ikke slik at økologisk frukt og grønt automatisk inneholder mer vitaminer og mineraler enn ikke-økologiske produkter. Dette avhenger blant annet av jordsmonn, solforhold osv. der det dyrkes.

Derfor er Kolonihagen opptatt av å velge de aller beste produsentene, som produserer langt over minstekravet i økologi. Aller helst velger vi biodynamisk der hvor det er mulig.

About Elvebredden Catering
The word Elvebredden translated to english means literally Riverside. When the company was founded in 2003, our kitchen and preparation facilities were located on the bank of the river Akerselven, and for this reason the first company vehicle was in fact a small boat for making deliveries to islands, other boats and locations along the Oslo harbor.

Today, 18 years later, Elvebredden Catering is one of Oslo´s largest catering suppliers and employs between 50-90 people, depending on the season. Since the very beginning our team of drivers, cooks, servers, and office workes have been an international group of people from just about every corner of the world.

The menu includes Norwegian party-food staples, but we are best known for tapas and a contemporary continental selection of dishes for fine dining and informal events. 

In 2017 we had a total turnover of approx. 53 million NOK.

2942,7317524,A. Idsøe,"Det hele ble startet i 1828 av Tore Idsøe, som kom fra øya Idsø i Ryfylke. Tore Idsøe hadde en stund et gardsbruk mellom Petrikirken og Blaasenborg. Mesteparten av disse eiendommene ble solgt og pengene ble investert i Bakerbryggen 9 som lå midt i den nåværende Verksgata. I 1855 overtok sønnen Albert ansvaret. Bedriften hadde en lang blomstringstid og var den første i sin bransje som anla eget fryseri og tok i bruk både dampkraft og elektrisitet.

I 1898 flyttet de inn i større og bedre lokaler i Verksgata 3 og 5 hvor bedriften fremdeles har tilhold. Alberts to sønner, Albert og Adolf overtok ansvaret i 1902 og la grunnlaget for det som skulle bli landets største private kjøttbedrift. Siden overtok Alberts sønn Martin styringen. På det meste hadde bedriften over 70 ansatte. Under krisen i trettiårene og deretter 5 års krigstid var mangelen på kjøpekraft og råvarer stor, og den faglige kreativiteten ble satt på en hard prøve.

Så fulgte etterkrigstiden, med rasjonering og prisreguleringer langt opp i 50- og tildels 60-årene. I 70-årene førte supermarkedenes inntog til at man kunne kjøpe et bredt utvalg kjøttprodukter sammen med melk og brød. Kjøttbutikkene fikk dermed kraftig konkurranse, og de aller fleste måtte til slutt innstille. A. Idsøe as holdt imidlertid stand, nå under ledelse av Martins sønn Albert.

1999 overtok sjette generasjon i rett nedstigende linje, Albert jr. roret. Det har vært et prinsipp ved hvert eneste generasjonskifte at den ""yngre""​ tidlig har tatt over ansvaret for å bringe bedriften videre. Her ligger kanskje noe av forklaringen på bedriftens suksess! De senere årene har bedriften befestet sin posisjon som byens spesialforetning for kjøtt og ""fine food""​. Vi er stolte over å ha bidratt til å øke bevisstheten rundt kvalitet for stadig flere kunder. 

Gamle håndverkstradisjoner og nytenkning går hånd i hånd, slik det alltid har gjort hos A. Idsøe.

Bakeryrket hadde vært i slekten i hele 5 generasjoner da Tor Sevaldsen startet opp eget bakeri og utsalg ved St.Hanshaugen i Kristiansund i 1972. Den gang var de bare 3 ansatte - et koselig lite bakgårdsbakeri.

I 1981 flyttet Tor Sevaldsen Konditori AS ut til Innlandet i Kristiansund. Her bakte de brød, boller og kaker til byens befolkning. Det duftet da alltid deilig på Innlandet.

Etter 10 år på Innlandet flyttet Tor Sevaldsen inn i nye moderne lokaler på Løkkemyra i 1991. Nå var det omtrent 20 personer som hadde sitt arbeid ved bedriften.

Lokalene gjennomgikk en utbygging i september 1998. Denne utbyggingen ble gjort på bakgrunn av en stor vekst innenfor området ""Lunsjmat""​.

I juni 2003 er vi ferdige med nok en omfattende utbygging. Denne gangen bygget ut 700 m2 som ga totalt 1.500 m2. Da sysselsatte vi 55 personer og var blitt en viktig bedrift i Kristiansund.

I januar 2008 kjøpte Tor Sevaldsen Baker Kjersem AS i Ålesund og Bud Bakeri AS i Bud. Dette ble gjort for og få et større marked og kapasitet i Møre og Romsdal. Vi har etter det mange viktige dagligvarekunder over hele fylket.

16. oktober 2009 flyttet produksjonen inn i et nytt moderne bakeri på Løkkemyra. Produksjonsbedriften hadde da endret navn til Tor Sevaldsen Produksjon AS.

06. Juni 2011 startet vi opp med nytt bakeri i Ålesund på Blindheim.

The year is 2009, and the place is the hometown of world-renowned storyteller H. C. Andersen. 

A businessman, who used to have his hands – and mind – full, sits down to think. The silence allows his mind to run free. With more than 25 years in the cargo security business, he has met many obstacles; heard every question. He knows just about every challenge.

He thinks of lashing equipment, which hasn’t changed since its invention. But why?

When it comes to safety and efficiency, there are obvious drawbacks to the existing equipment. For instance, inserting the webbing into the ratchet is a time-consuming process. He knows he can make this process both easier and quicker.

Countless thoughts, ideas, and gadgets see the light of day over the next couple of years. There’s progress, but also dead ends. Then, in 2016, he’s got it: a fully functional prototype. It’s easy to use and both economically and ergonomically superior to the original, so he names it Ergolash®.  

Determined to transform his prototype into a quality product ready to be used by the demanding cargo industry, he keeps working on it. This innovative version of an old product is sure to attract attention, and the cargo industry will benefit from it. 

Wanting to protect his invention, the businessman applies for a world patent.

Finally, in 2019, he gets his patent. Endless tests prove the worth of Ergolash® time and time again, and production begins.

The Graae quality
Leather craftsmanship created with passion for uncompromising quality.

First and foremost, we select the best hides and skin. We have always worked with some of the best tanneries in the world, including Italian tannery Tempesti through which we buy vegetable tanned and aniline dyed calfskin. This kind of leather is tanned from natural plant extracts such as oak bark, rhubarb,eucalyptus and acacia bark. Using the highest quality of skins, we make sure that our products patinate beautifully and stay with our customers for years. Another central component is the hardware we use, including belt buckles, hinges and locks. These are all our own design and all made from solid brass which is plated with silver and palladium. Plating with palladium on top of the silver secure that the hardware will maintain the same look, even after many years of daily use.

Design
A Graae product is characterised by functionality, quality and a timeless design that can stand the test of time. We cater to the classic - yet modern - man who is focused on product quality rather than logos. In everything we do, we strive to design leather goods that will stay with you for a lifetime.",Wholesale,1-10 employees,2022-03-21T21:48:44.632Z,True

We’ve set out on an exciting journey to merge the power of bacon, foodtech and pop culture to drive the positive change our world needed yesterday.

Treat yourself with a deep breath and imagine a world with peace. Imagine a world free from  hate, no matter where you’re born or who you happen to fall in love with. Imagine a world without gender, social or economic inequality. Imagine a world where no human needs to starve. Imagine a world  where all species live in harmony. Imagine a world that makes Mother Nature proud again. Sounds lovely, doesn’t it?

So, will Raging Pig Company make this Utopia become reality? Most definitely not.

However, the birth of Raging Pig Company will let us humans enjoy the delicious taste of bacon without having to be a part of the, not so delicious, pig slaughtering circus ending the life of 1.5 billion life-loving pigs every year.

Background:
We are at a point in history where it is fully possible for every living being to live a good life.

But what we are seeing is gross inequality, poverty, conflict and a breakdown of our fragile ecosystem. Even in the richest, most peaceful parts of the world, people are stressed out and far from being as happy as they could be.

We have come to look at the world through lenses of scarcity. We believe that in order for us to win someone has to lose.

This belief is deeply rooted in us, so we come to see getting and giving as mutually exclusive: You either chase your own happiness or your sacrifice your chance of success to help others.

But we are misguided. Surely there is a middle ground. Surely it is possible to create a healthy balance between doing good for ourselves and doing good for others.

AMOV will prove our old scripts wrong. We will show how success is best measured in human values, rather than just shareholder value, profit and GDP.
We will prove that happiness can come from balancing all things; especially getting and giving. 

Tackling a notoriously non-sustainable industry; we are creating an apparel brand. Through our work and example, we wish to start a movement. A movement towards a society where people, businesses and politicians find it natural to act responsibly and with compassion.

""Profit matching"" is our way of balancing our financial success with our responsibility to give back; to do good in the world. Specifically it means that for every penny we earn (after taxes and interest) we must at least raise a similar amount for doing good through various activities, campaigns, funds, what not...

Our target is to produce workwear so that the environmental strain that they cause during their life cycle is as small as possible. Quality, product safety and the transparency of the production process are the cornerstones of responsibility.

We dare to think differently. We dare to challenge technology. We dare to fail and our comfort zone has expanded. We have developed the first elastic technical material to endure the industrial laundering. 

We have also created workwear collection which is motivating, it increases employee's commitment and improves the atmosphere at work. A trendy, functional work outfit creates a recognisable professional identity.

Buchardt Audio is a Danish based high-end loudspeaker manufacturer. Our goal is to provide state-of-the-art sound at an affordable price. We have succeeded in this task with the help of some of the most talented developers and engineers in the industry. Our speakers are the product of a long and meticulous design process.

Don't let the cost of our speakers dissuade you. They can compete with products well above their price range.

Reaching these prices without compromise is impossible. If compromises on the product and development processes are not an option, we need to look elsewhere. We have eliminated expensive marketing, distributors, agents and Hi-Fi dealers. By selling directly to the end user, we eliminate about 60-70% of the cost in comparison to our competitors. Direct sales is not anything new. More and more small companies are doing this. What makes us different is that we rely on big scale production where we produce thousands of speakers in batches, so we benefit from the best possible prices on the parts we use.    

Our focus is purely on consistent performance and quality. To achieve this, we outsource production to a company that knows what it’s doing, and can handle the large scale production we need. The company is the respected Danish/Chinese-owned Company: Hansong in Nanjing, China. Hansong has extensive experience in manufacturing for some of the most well known High-End Hi-Fi brands in the world! 

To us, it is of vital importance that the production facility we use offers the best working conditions for the employees. Hansong offers special healthcare benefits to all employees along with apartments and free electric bus rides to the city. Hansong is ISO 9001 certified and has facilities in China, Denmark and USA.

Og at der bliver lagt planer om, at gøre verden til et bedre sted at være. At dele et måltid er at tage en pause fra verden, og bare være sammen.

Vores mission er, at der skal stå en flaske Sens Food dressing på alle borde, hvor der bliver delt et måltid.

Vi elsker mad, og vi vil gerne have det til at smage af lidt mere. For os er mad ikke bare noget, vi stopper i munden – det er en oplevelse. Vores dressing er no bullshit, og vi lover at dine gæster vil elske dig, når du sætter en flaske Sens Food Dressing på bordet.

Vi har lavet dressing siden 2004. I begyndelsen langede vi vores pizzadressing over disken i vores pizzeria i Morsø i Nordjylland. Udgangspunktet har altid været at lave en dressing, som vi selv havde lyst til at spise, men vi vidste, at vi havde fat i noget, da kunderne begyndte at bede om at kunne købe dressingen med hjem. Siden har vi forfinet opskriften, og nye dressinger er kommet til.

.....................................Its not only a name, it´s a total concept!...............................

We are very true to our design, where elements such as
bows, dots and stripes are always present.
All the shoes in the collection have a girly name allowing our customers to identify
themselves with the product and the brand.

Have you once fallen in love with the certain fit
of ex. Angie, Elsie or any of the others..
Just remember the name, and the fit of the shoe - it will always be the same.

An important element in the brand philosophy is humor.
We always strive to take the design further than you would expect ..
We show the unexpected and top it off with that important element of humor!

The team behind Lola Ramona is very dedicated to the design.
And they are the ones who make Lola Ramona come to life.

Philosophy
Women's feet are a cause for celebration and pampering.
All Lola Ramona shoes and boots are based on thoroughly analysed
and developed designs, guaranteeing your feet good support.
Because of this you can enjoy both, the high and low stilettos,
the chunkier heeled pumps and the beautiful wooden wedges.
− the design and construction will allow you to dance
the night away, or shop all day long without sore feet.

Vores store fælles glæde for at formidle velvære og stil via tøj & tilbehør har vi har nydt at kunne dele. Vi har i mange år leget med tanken om at kunne skabe en virksomhed sammen, hvor vores kreative ideer og tanker kunne gavne andre end os selv.

O’TAY er et feminint online univers, hvor du som kunde er i fokus. Vi har skabt et univers, hvor der er fokus på detaljer, kvalitet og tilgængelighed. Vi skaber kollektioner, der både kan bruges af yngre – og lidt ældre, smarte piger.
Vi vil væk fra ”køb og smid væk” kulturen og skabe mode, man har lyst til at bruge igen og igen. En stil – og materialer – der holder, blot sat sammen på forskellige måder.

Vores materialevalg og samarbejdspartnere har været gennem en kritisk rejse, for vi kræver lækkerhed og kvalitet til overkommelige priser. Det skal være tøj, som vi vil forkæle os selv med at tage på og gå ud i verden og udstråle selvsikkerhed og livsglæde.

Der er ikke et skel mellem generationer i forhold til, hvad man kan tage på. Det drejer sig udelukkende om, hvem du er, hvad du har det godt i, og hvad du gerne vil udstråle.

Føler man sig godt tilpas – så kan verden bare komme an! Ordsproget ”Klæder skaber folk” er sagt af en meget viis person, og det er så rigtigt. Vi ønsker med vores brand O`TAY at skabe en unik stil der også matcher noget du allerede har i din garderobe.

OUR VISION
Fashion is fun and meant to be for everyone regardless of age, budget, size & style. Fashion is our way of expressing ourselves but should also not have to be something that compromises on our environmental and ethical values. We at Stilrent want to offer an easy, fun, environmentally friendly and affordable way of renting clothes & accessories to make fashion accessible for everyone.

 

OUR APPROACH
Sustainability is the very core of our business, and something we are not willing to compromise on. By renting instead of purchasing, we are providing an alternative option where we are increasing the life length of the clothes, fighting against fast-fashion and making sure that the clothes are taken care of like they should and spreading joy to multiple people instead of being left hanging in the back corner of a closet and forgotten about.

Gastrotools er en dansk virksomhed med rødder i København. Bag virksomheden står ildsjælen Julius Søndergård Schiller, som i 2016 satte sig for at udvikle en serie af køkkenværktøj ud fra et hovedkriterie - det skal holde hele livet.

Vi mener, at køkkenværktøj er værktøj - at det skal udføre en funktion til perfektion. Men vi mener også, at det skal støtte op om og bidrage til glæden ved at gå i køkkenet hver dag. Med udgangspunkt i nogle af verdens mest avancerede materialer og smedeteknikker, har vi skabt en køkkenkniv, som både byder på æstetisk skønhed og ekstrem skarphed. Uden at gå på kompromis med balance, slidstyrke og ergonomi.

Det er køkkenknive for livet.

Men tanken er også, at dine køkkenknive skal være til at betale. Vores køkkenknive smedes af enestående stål fra Japan i tæt samarbejde med nogle af verdens dygtigste smedemestre. Vi har ingen mellemled, som skal tjene penge, og derfor kan vi tilbyde en exceptionel kvalitet til lavere priser end køkkenknive i samme klasse.

Vores udvalg af køkkenværktøj er skåret helt ind til benet. Vi udbyder et smalt sortiment af køkkenknive og køkkenværktøj i et tidsløst og elegant design - smedet af japansk stål med en unik mineralsammensætning. Køkkenknive du kan have glæde af resten af livet.

Alle vores køkkenknive er udviklet som værktøj. Dine køkkenknive skal arbejde for dig, når du laver mad. Det sikrer vi, ved at tage udgangspunkt i ståltyper og skæftematerialer med ekstrem hårdhed og styrke.

Idéen bag Den ultimative køkkenkniv er egentlig enkel. Det handler i sin enkelthed om at skabe et værktøj, en køkkenkniv, som kombinerer æstetisk skønhed og funktionalitet. Men forud for udviklingen går en lang og kompleks proces, som skal sikre optimal ergonomi, balance og skarphed - i én pakke.",Retail,1-10 employees,2022-03-21T21:49:21.830Z,True

The BIKEZAC is an innovative shopping bag, made of recycled woven PP, a solid and sustainable material. However, its special feature is its innovative, patented mounting rail. Thanks to it, the shopping bag can be attached to a bicycle's luggage rack with only 2 clicks, making shopping by bike easier and safe.

With the three buzzwords #convenient, #ecofriendly and #safe in mind, we have worked hard over the last few years to refine the idea of the BIKEZAC and improve and optimize its design. 
More than satisfied with the current solution, we now focus on making the alternative shopping bag accessible in Denmark and other European countries. 

We are convinced that the BIKEZAC is an innovative alternative for single use plastic bags. Yet, in order to have a positive effect on the preservation of the environment, many individuals have to choose the sustainable way. To make the BIKEZAC easily accessible, we are continuously expanding our network of retailers. Besides that, we are collaborating with various companies that customize the BIKEZAC  with their logo.

Children are open-minded, curious, playful and wonderfully creative. As parents, we, Mia and Louise, observe and enjoy this approach to life every day and we owe a lot of our best ideas to our children. Each style and every little detail are designed and made by us. Our designs are inspired by modern and conceptional arts and colors, different animal shapes and textures and the comfortable and functional elements of streetwear. We believe children are free to wear whatever they want, and a lot of our clothes are therefore not gender-specific. We tailor-make our prototypes to ensure the design fits children’s shape and movements. This makes our clothes comfortable to play in. When children play, they get messy – and children have to play! To resist the hard job of being worn by playing children all day, our clothes are made of high-quality textiles.

The tech industry is growing enormously, as a result of which the demand for people with the right skills is growing faster than the supply. With an innovative way of teaching, we ensure that our students develop these necessary skills. We train developers to start working immediately and teach professionals how to perform their work more efficiently with the help of (low/no-) code tools.

Winc Academy makes learning to program accessible to everyone by offering remote training courses, which you can start right away. All courses can be followed at your own pace and without any specific prior education. Despite this flexible approach, we find it important that Winc remains personal. We know our students and you know us and your fellow students! Learning (online) together is much more fun and instructive than alone.

Winc was founded in 2018 as a 100% remote school, so remote learning is in our DNA. We do not believe that it is enough to put a camera on a teacher and have everyone log in at home via a video conferencing tool. Remote teaching is much more than that. For example, how do you build a teaching program so students do not lose their attention? Or how do we ensure that we stay in touch with each other? How do we achieve a learning goal together? And how do we know if you really get it?

We've spent a lot of love and attention on all of these themes, and continue to do so on a daily basis. Because of this, our model has continued to improve in recent years.

3463,11465958,Patta Exclusive Sneakers BV.,"Out of love and necessity rather than profit and novelty, Patta opened its doors in 2004. Situated right in the city heart of Amsterdam, the store literally became the center of attention by bringing new excitement to the Dutch street wear scene.

Founded by Edson Sabajo and Guillaume ‘Gee’ Schmidt as a means to provide themselves, as well as their friends and family with a steady supply of footwear and gear, that which has started as a hobby, has now flourished into a thriving business and recognizable brand. Both prominent figures in the Dutch Hip-Hop scene in the 90’s and early 2000’s, Edson as a DJ and Gee as host/MC, it was these common interests that grew into a strong friendship and viable business partnership.

Before the Tier 0, Quickstrike and Consortium accounts, the team traveled across the planet with wads of cash in their pockets, visiting obscure sneaker stores and buying vast amounts of footwear that was unavailable to the Dutch public. Without any shipping accounts or even knowledge of the like, they either posted huge boxes of shoes back to their hometown, or they threw them in big duffelbags and try to bring them back on the plane. This unwavering determination to make success happen, the just-do-it-yourself mentality and the willingness to go against the grain are the foundation of Patta's identity.

Aside from footwear staples such as Nike, adidas, Converse, ASICS, Reebok, KangaROOS, New Balance and Diadora, you can also find products from brands like Stüssy, Rockwell and Patta's in-house brand and more.

When Patta started out, the logo was used to make a small batch of t-shirts for friends, family and loyal customers. As demand was higher than expected, more were made and eventually evolved into our in-house brand. Starting out small with a capsule in the summer of 2011 available at five retailers worldwide, the collection has grown exponentially in size, quality and availability with 15 retailers stocking the brand.",Retail,51-200 employees,2022-04-04T09:49:08.488Z,True

Our material and production process makes the 3D4Makers filament particularly suitable for FDM and FFF 3D printers. The material has an excellent adhesion between the layers. This results in great improvement of the impact resistance, strength, durability, the printing process and “warping”.

From our biobased materials to our manufacturing in the Netherlands, we’re raising awareness about sustainability while delivering unquestionably safe products. We believe that the best way to encourage environmental change is through goods people buy and use every day. Our story started with a dream of a father. 

To prevent the temperature from rising any further BiOBUDDi searched for a resource of their products that absorbs carbon dioxide. A resource which is recyclable and usable for the production of toys for children. We discovered these traits in sugarcane plants. These plants absorb carbon dioxide to grow while turning it into oxygen.  Sugarcane plants are used by the food industry but also for clothing and medicine. 

The plant has a lot of usage but it also leaves some non-usable part. That non-usable part is the main part of the natural compound that BiOBUDDi uses for their products. The non-usable part of these sugarcane processing can be used to create bio-ethanol, this is a kind of alcohol used to create green polyethylene (Green PE). This polyethylene is compounded in Europe with extra natural resources. The compound that is created with this is patented by BiOBUDDi. All BiOBUDDi products are made with the compound that is highly biobased and we are the only using this unique compound in the world. It is a process that results in a large saving of CO2 in the atmosphere. It is a process that is circular.

Het jeanslabel focust zich op de lange mannen van Nederland, echter betekent het niet dat Bukser Jeans alleen geschikt is voor lange mannen, ook de doorsnee man kan zich kleden in een Bukser Jeans. 

Bij het merk zijn er smallere taillematen voor lange mannen wat uniek is en lastig te vinden, men start bij taille maat 28 en loopt door tot 36 en heeft lengte maten van 32 t/m 38.

Bukser Jeans produceert milieubewust en zorgt voor hoge kwaliteit, zo werken zij met de prachtige stof Candiani die bekend staat om een kwalitatieve en milieubewuste stof die niet meer weg te denken is in de jeanswereld. 

Ook vindt Bukser Jeans de arbeidsomstandigheden erg belangrijk en kiest daarom de productie plaats te laten vinden in Portugal, waar zij nauw contact hebben met de producent en regelmatig de fabriek bezoekt.

We aim to build bridges between different contexts and backgrounds while offering a platform for creativity.

_________________________________________________________________________

Origin The New Originals find their early beginnings in 2011, as a close group of friends running a blog to share and curate interests within fashion, design and music. TNO started making name in Amsterdam’s nightlife scene by hosting parties at its infamous venues under the pseudonym TNO SoundSystem. Officially founded in 2015 by Rizky Lasahido, Maru Asmellash and Eben Badu, TNO has since then grown into a full fledged brand. ‘



Think out of the Box
The 9 Dots logo represents a box, referring to an old riddle. The puzzle proposes the challenge to connect all 9 Dots with 4 straight lines. To solve this puzzle, all one requires to do is ‘Think out of the Box’, this has become the motto and spirit under which we operate!



What else?
The basis is and remains of course clothing but our creativity reaches far beyond. As a brand, we are deeply rooted in Amsterdam’s cultural landscape. Grounded in its many components and disciplines such as art, music, fashion, nightlife and other areas of creative expression.

Our curriculum vitae runs deep. Besides the numerous collaborations with creatives, artists and musicians you may know us from our partnerships with cultural organisations and museums or whipping up and serving our own milkshakes as TNO Milkshake Farmers or of our own yearly music festival with our close friends Smib for SMIB X TNO Fest.",Apparel & Fashion,11-50 employees,2022-04-04T09:49:23.637Z,True

Gabbiano® is an urban casual lifestyle brand influenced by Italian roots and fine Dutch craftsmanship. Our path started in Tuscany, Italy, with a journey that inspired us to make a global fashion brand for the urban man. The Tuscany landscapes, Its history, and the appreciation for high culture inspired us to create this brand. At Gabbiano we believe in good quality and know that every small detail matters. We embrace challenges, seek new opportunities, and always remain authentic.
Since 2011 GABBIANO has been combining innovation and attention to detail to create the Gabbiano Men's Collection.” Clothing of great quality with a perfect fit”. Gabbiano operates in the mid-high segment and targets men who embrace the urban way of life. We distribute our collections throughout Europe through selected local premium retailers, department stores and e-commerce partners.

OUR GOAL

We design Gabbiano for the man who goes beyond just tradition and stays innovative with his look. A free man who loves to travel and explore, never giving life an opportunity to become dull. His days are filled with excitement and action, whether at home, at work, or on the move to his next destination. He doesn’t follow the crowd, instead he creates his own journey. This is ‘The urban way of life’.  This is GABBIANO.

OUR INSPIRATION

To stay innovative with our collections, we travel to major urban cities for inspiration. Each city has its unique balance between nature and structure which we use in combination to create our unique themes. Every part of our collections has its own story. We create collections complete from top to bottom, crafted especially for the Gabbiano man. The key to our collections is balancing our unique identity, high quality clothing, and creating the perfect fit. Each detail is carefully thought through by our experienced designers. The most important goal we have is to let the Gabbiano man express himself though quality fashion.

Located in Haarlem, The Netherlands, we’re setting up reliable supply chains to provide all market segments with the right quality used and refurbished devices.

Extending the lifespan of hardware devices is a matter of ensuring that nothing goes to waste. The proverb “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure” exactly describes our vision on each device that enters our grading pipeline. Different buyers have different demands, which sometimes complement each other, sometimes intersect, and sometimes are completely disjoint from one another. Our broad experience with Apple hardware and extensive international network provide us with the essential knowledge in mapping the demands of specific market segments to the classifications produced by our grading methodology. The grading system is fully data-driven using a plethora of metrics - producing a consistent quality in all grades defined by Molano. This ensures the most optimal life cycle of Apple devices, so that each device is eventually directed to the right buyer.

Building out on our core business, Molano contributes towards a flourishing circular economy with our full-service repair and grading facility (planned 2022). A unified service and distribution point for any customer demand - from retailers and repair shops to wholesalers and corporations, our facility functions as the hub that distributes and redistributes Apple devices. Devices go in and go out, and in each cycle are subjected to our thorough grading processes. The returns of one buyer might often serve the demand of another, delaying the retirement of a device as long as possible, and eventually decommissioning it into parts  and eventually decommissioning it into parts and raw materials suitable for recycling.",Wholesale,1-10 employees,2022-04-04T09:49:23.637Z,False

Our dream is to bring art, stories and culture closer together through fashion and to give young artists a platform to showcase their talent. We aim to do this while we work towards building a more conscious future together in the fashion industry. We hope to achieve this through the process our fashions are made, through the fabrics we select, through the partners we connect with and the collaborations we build.

We collaborate with talented artists from Africa and provide them with a platform to share their art through our every new collection. Every single purchase made helps development artistic talent and job creation in South Africa.

 

Every collection piece represents a timeless, modern silhouette. Our customers lead busy lives, so we aim to deliver ‘on-the-go’ sophistication in our clothing that can stand the test of time. Our fashions detail printed art along with non-printed items that have translated the art story through the use of design, colour, high quality and natural fabrics.

 

We are passionate about making a difference and in partnering with others who feel the same. We work hard to deliver responsible business practices and partner with like-minded suppliers. Relationships are of utmost importance to us.

 

One of our greatest loves is for our South African upliftment program with a percentage of our turnover going into the Rhumaa Foundation. Here, we support projects and skills development programs in the under-developed communities of Cape Town that help young artists build creative skills that support them with job opportunities.

The GoodPeople is vibrant, playful, confident, imperfect, edgy, self-conscious, honest and has an eye for details. He loves to celebrate life. Living his life the way his heart tells him to, he is not afraid to make mistakes. In fact, he is as proud of his successes as he is of his imperfections. This makes him the character he is.

Exploring new routes, he constantly pushes boundaries. However, The GoodPeople is not just another rebel. He knows the etiquette for good behaviour but sometimes just likes to break free from society’s expectations. Yes, he is the grown-up bon vivant who always remained his boyish outlook on life. People love to be with him and he shows everyone a good time. A charmer at heart, he likes to play and is always up for a laugh. Always.

Inspired by life itself, GoodPeople is a fashion label that celebrates both the joys and trials of being a man. This is reflected throughout the brand’s portfolio, combining refined quality with deliberate imperfection. From a strong line of fitted shirts, to hand finished knits and tailored blazers: the offbeat yet functional designs, vibrant detailing and contrasting schemes emphasise a man’s character.

Our ethics

We believe in the diversity and equal rights of our affiliates. That’s why we chose to partner with an atelier that fights child labor and offers exceptional working conditions. We personally vet and verify these conditions by frequent visits to the factories. This also allows us to maintain a trusted relationship with our teams.

Our story

BLUCACTUS was born out of the unconditional love between parents and his son. The story began in India when I decided to leave my home country and travel to Europe. My parents wanted to encapsulate their relationship, so they decided to personally design and make a leather jacket for me. This touching gesture motivated me to share this gift and create unique pieces of leather at affordable prices for all to enjoy. Always inspired by my roots, I wanted to pay tribute to my Indian culture through some of my collections. Like the cactus, all the designs are full of character, durable, and long-lasting.

Begin september 2020 ontdekken artsen bij de zevenjarige Maas kanker. Maas ondergaat een intensief behandeltraject in het Prinses Máxima Centrum. Agnita, vriendin van de ouders van Maas, maakt elke paar dagen een tekening van een avontuur van Maas en zijn magische eenhoorn. Deze tekeningen en verhalen zijn het begin van bijzondere avonturen… 
Stichting Maas is in januari 2021 opgericht met als doel fondsen te werven voor onderzoek naar kinderkanker. De feiten over kinderkanker geven aan hoe belangrijk geld voor onderzoek naar kinderkanker is. De gehele netto opbrengst wordt dan ook gedoneerd aan het Prinses Màxima Centrum voor onderzoeksprojecten. 

Stichting Maas werft fondsen op diverse manieren:
* Het prentenboek “De avonturen van Maas en zijn magische eenhoorn” wordt verkocht via stichting Maas www.deavonturenvanmaas.nl
* Verkoop van producten die zorgen voor een glimlach en een bijdrage aan het doel van stichting Maas mogelijk maken
* Magische initiatieven met bedrijven die hun maatschappelijke betrokkenheid willen omzetten in een concrete bijdrage. Onder andere spinningmarathons, relatiegeschenken aan klanten en benefietavonden. 
* Duurzame financiële bijdragen van bedrijven en mooie mensen. Stichting Maas is een officieel goed doel met een ANBI-status, waardoor doneren fiscaal aantrekkelijk is.

Carolien Vlieger and Hein van Dam, trained as graphic designer and industrial designer, respectively, started the VLIEGER & VANDAM label in 2004 in response to the overwhelming success of their collaboration in 2002. This collaboration named ‘The Guardian Angel Handbag’ was a comment from both designers on all the media attention to street violence in the city of Rotterdam, the place where they had just settled. Those early Guardian Angels were assembled with parts from second hand handbags and new brightly coloured felt embossed with distinct profiles. A handbag turned out to be the perfect vehicle for an international widely felt and far from salon fähig sentiment.

3652,14050689,DemarkQ,"At DemarkQ, our mission is to use LED light technology to provide safe and effective solutions for teenage acne. We combine non-invasive acne treatments with a skin positive approach to pave the way to universal beauty acceptance.

Acne is a common skin affliction that affects many teenagers and adults. It is a skin condition that requires evidence-based treatment and care. However, the shame surrounding it makes us feel like our acne is an indicator of our beauty, hygiene, and self-worth. It is not. 

That’s why it’s time to shine a light on acne (literally) to treat the condition AND the stigma surrounding it. 

What drives us?

We’re passionate about acne as a whole:
We care. A LOT. Our products are made to not only add value to your skincare routine but also your sense of self. Healing acne is just a small part of the stigma that surrounds it and we are willing to change that. 

We have fun:
We hope we can be a reminder that life is much bigger than your skin. Your skin texture doesn’t define your worth and so shouldn’t stop you from enjoying your life.

We’re reliable:
We’ve taken every step to ensure you and your skin get the best possible care. We’ve paid close attention to both the efficacy and safety of our devices so you don’t have to worry about that.  

We tell the truth:
It’s simple. If we don’t believe in it, we don’t sell it. Our products are made to work. 

We’re not afraid to take the lead: 
We’re not afraid to go against industry standards(or any standard really) on what it means to be beautiful. This is reflected in our ads, images, and everything else. 

We invite change:
Progress is our middle name. We believe in constant innovation is crucial to shaping a better tomorrow. So, we’re never afraid to ask the question, can we do better?

3660,10255275,Royal Tea & Coffee Sticks,"NO MESS, NO DRIPS, NO SPOON 

As a young entrepreneurial start-up in 2008, we developed T-Sticks to initially solve a messy problem and allow businesses and consumers to save time and costs within high footfall HORECA environments, especially within offices, events and conferences across airliners, cruise liners and trains. Our message is simple: ‘make life easier’. 

What are T-Sticks? A ready-to-brew infuser stick made with finely selected leaf tea from around the world. A premium alternative to tea bags and loose leaf tea. 

T-Sticks solve a genuine problem and our tagline sums it up simply: 

No mess 
No drips 
No spoon 

Making a cup of tea has never been so easy. 


We make our tea a little different. In fact, we’ve done away with the teabag entirely. 

With T-Sticks, you can enjoy your tea when you’re on the go because there’s no need for a teaspoon, which means no mess. 

More importantly, T-Sticks are made from proper leaf tea with all the good stuff like antioxidants and no tea dust like regular teabags. 

How It Works 
Place your T-Stick into a cup of freshly boiled water. Stir the T-Stick and give it optimal time to infuse. We recommend a minimum of 2 minutes. That’s it. If you like, add lemon or milk, sugar or honey and enjoy. 


Be Smart

It’s clever but simple. 427 evenly-spaced micro perforations on each of our T-Sticks, so that tea tannins aren’t concentrated and our tea never steeps and gets bitter.

The Foil
Ordinary filter paper would absorb the actual tea taste and brewing colloids etc, where as our perforated foil releases the full flavour back into the cup. While paper tea bags may contain noxious substances such as remainders of glues or plant-protective agents like pesticides etc, our perorated foil is manufactured according to EU standards.

Als school het toelaat, ontdek ik graag de wereld en reis ik naar voor mij onbekende plekken. Ik ben iemand die open staat voor het ontdekken van het onbekende en zo ben ik in december 2018 begonnen om mijn dromen te realiseren. Ik heb met behulp van een aantal lieve mensen mijn eigen webshop kunnen opzetten. Door mijn studie heb ik het leven van een jonge ondernemer leren kennen en mijn interesse op het gebied van fashion en lifestyle kunnen ontwikkelen. Ik ben eerst klein begonnen met alleen een Instagram account. Al snel kwam ik er achter dat ik dit ontzettend tof vind om te doen waardoor ik de drive heb gevonden om het groter aan te pakken. Ik ben trots om te zien dat een klein idee uitgegroeid is tot een heel mooi resultaat.

Met La Eva Store wil ik laten zien dat basis accessoires ook heel fashionable kunnen zijn en makkelijk te combineren met elke outfit. Om in een land met een overweldigend aanbod van kleding en accessoires op te blijven vallen, pak ik het net even iets anders aan. Het is voor mij belangrijk dat mijn producten toegankelijk zijn voor iedereen en jij als bezoeker, je aangesproken voelt tot de verschillende producten. Laat je inspireren door het aanbod die ik dagelijks zelf selecteer en bekijk mijn collectie!

I believe that no animal should be hurt by making beautiful bags and accessories. That’s why I’m very happy all of DENISE ROOBOL’s products are PETA-approved. Besides the vegan aspect, I wanted to prove that vegan products can be fashionable and trendy. With DENISE ROOBOL, I hope to inspire all woman how easy and nice it can be to wear vegan fashion.

VEGAN MICROFIBRE LEATHER
All of DENISE ROOBOL’s products are made of vegan Microfiber, a material that is made from pressed fibers. The material has a strong coating, which protects it against sunlight and water.  The combination of Microfiber and the strong coating makes the material superstrong, sustainable and water-resistant.
 
Microfiber is the most high-quality alternative for leather and has the same suppleness and feeling. It’s not needed to use a spray to protect the material.
Microfiber is available in different thicknesses. Every design has their own different thickness. For a minimalistic design we often choose for a thick material. While thinner material matches perfectly with a more casual look. The thickness of the material says nothing about the quality of the bag, but more about the look and feel of the bag.

ATELIER
The atelier where are the DENISE ROOBOL bags a produced is 3 hours driving from Hong Kong. This atelier is not as large with only 10 to 15 well experienced craftsmen.
The studio is fresh, light and spacious. This atelier in Guangzhou excels in the quality they deliver, every product gets the time and attention to make it look perfect.",Apparel & Fashion,1-10 employees,2022-04-04T09:49:48.328Z,True

Vanuit het chocolade-atelier en Koffiehuis dat gevestigd is in het prachtige Ludgerusgebouw in Vierakker wordt de chocolade verkocht.

We are convinced that waste material has huge value and it deserves a second life, by thinking out the box we came up with solutions that can make this happen. That is why we want to use our innovative and beautiful products to lead awareness and consciousness about sustainability across the globe.

We work hard to be sure that our products are balanced between sustainability, beautiful design and social impact. Sustainability needs beauty, and beauty without positive impact is not fun. Only after reaching a perfect balance we can offer stylish and unique products with amazing stories behind them.

Since the starting we have been ensuring that our raw materials get a completely new function through a simple adjustment. In 2012 our “Newaste” program was started to pre-cycle waste from major manufacturers, by pre-cycling we take advantage of the hidden value of waste material before it gets recycled. Recycling is good, but only ideal if the material is completely useless.

Our innovative supply chain creates value for the environment because with clever use and reuse of materials, recycling would become less necessary. Therefore, we contribute to extend life of equipment, save unnecessary energy consumption, and maintaining the quality of the material. 

Additionally, we create value for our suppliers because their waste represents a cost for them. They buy on large scale precious and quality material to make their great products, each piece that they throw away remains costly for them and for our environment. That is why it is attractive for manufacturers to be part of our cost advantages because at the same time they can improve their processes in a sustainable way.

We believe in humans and social impact is important for us. That is why we produce in Dutch Prisons and Social Workshops.

Named after the most advance and last beginning position of ballet, Istanbul and Amsterdam based brand aims to create silhouettes like dancers’ suits in which women can live all day and move freely.
Born as the daughter of a ballet dancer, the founder of the brand Buse Uğur, has started dancing at a very early age. Buse started her dance education in classical ballet, but her free spirit led her to continue with contemporary dance. It was during these years when she first designed and sewed her very own dance suits. Using them as swimwear on beaches, she created her own fan base which eventually inspired the initial idea of the brand.

 In 2014, the first lookbook of the brand was shot with model Ezgi Bozkurt. Also a product designer and interior architectural designer, Ezgi fell in love with the idea of using dance as an inspiration for beachwear and became a good supporter and friend of Buse. This friendship lead to a partnership by the end of 2014. On March 2015, the fellow duo launched their first collection with a runway show on Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Istanbul.

 On its fourth season, 5thPosition swimwear is available on selected boutiques and stores worldwide. The brand is well-known and respected with a strong following, launched two seasons during MBFWI.",Textiles,1-10 employees,2022-04-04T09:50:09.079Z,True

Our solution: We are identifying points in microbial metabolic networks that can be leveraged to couple biotechnological production to microbial growth. This means that microbes are incentivized to keep producing products of interest because it is necessary for their own growth.
      To accomplish this, we are modifying the existing FRUITS algorithm, which
identifies opportunities for growth-coupled production within the metabolic network of a host organism. Traditionally, this algorithm has been limited to native metabolic products, but with our introduction of “Forbidden FRUITS” we will expand this tool to allow for the production of non-native metabolites, products that are not naturally made by a host microbe, and therefore ‘forbidden’, due to technological limitations. This conceptually means that we are expanding the variety of what we can produce, independent of which microbe is producing it. Salicylic acid made by E. coli? We are on it.

3928,40663684,Bakkerij Wim Koelman Brood-Banket-Bonbons,"Ambachtelijke bakkerij met (web)winkel in Heemskerk. Hét adres voor brood, banket en bonbons voor de regio IJmond. Bezorgt in Heemskerk, Beverwijk, Velsen-Noord, Uitgeest, Castricum, Assendelft en Akersloot. 

Wim Koelman Brood-Banket-Bonbons bestaat sinds 1983 en werd opgericht door naamgever Wim Koelman. Hij leidde de bakkerswinkel samen met zijn vrouw Mary, eerst aan de Maerten van Heemskerckstraat en sinds 1993 aan het Burgemeester Nielenplein 24-28 in Heemskerk. In 1994 droeg Wim de dagelijkse leiding officieel over aan zoon Sjon Koelman en zijn vrouw Nicole, maar hij bleef bij de zaak betrokken. In 2017 hebben we helaas te vroeg afscheid moeten nemen van onze oprichter. 

Sinds 26 augustus 2009 zijn de banketbakkers van Koelman grondleggers van het Heemskerkse Ezelsoor, Heemskerks eigen gebakje. De eigenwijze delicatesse is een blijvend succes en iedereen mag ze graag trakteren. Er zijn nu ook varianten, zoals het mini-ezelsoor en het Ezelsoor XL en XXL. En soms zijn er specials, bijvoorbeeld rode oren voor Valentijnsdag. Heemskerkse Ezelsoren zijn zo beroemd, dat ze zelfs hun eigen Facebook pagina hebben, met honderden fans tot ver over de gemeentegrenzen.

In maart 2014 heropende de banketbakkerij na een spectaculaire verbouwing. Dankzij het moderne interieur, exterieur en de bijpassende huisstijl, kan de stijlvolle winkel zich meten met de besten. De innovatie heeft zich niet beperkt tot het pand en het logo. Regelmatig verbeteren we bestaande lekkernijen en voegen we mooie producten toe aan ons brede assortiment. Daarbij focussen we altijd op topkwaliteit en ambachtelijkheid, zowel voor brood als banket. En het oog wil ook wat! Kom dus snel langs in onze winkel en zie de keuze met eigen ogen.

Wie Amazon maar een klein beetje heeft gevolgd de afgelopen jaren is het niet ontgaan dat het bedrijf enorm aan het uitbreiden is. Wat begon in een garage in Seattle (WA, USA) is in no-time uitgegroeid tot het grootste e-commerce bedrijf in de US met een marktaandeel van meer dan 49%, oftewel 5% van alle retail aankopen. Dit is echt ongekend. Het bedrijf is inmiddels uitgebreid over de gehele wereld en ook in Europa begint Amazon een steeds grotere speler te worden. Ze zijn begonnen met de United Kingdom, Duitsland, Frankrijk, Spanje en Italië, maar het ziet er naar uit dat Amazon ook in Nederland (Benelux) binnenkort voet aan de grond zal zetten en de strijd aan zal gaan met grote spelers als Bol.com en Coolblue. Nu is dan ook het ideale moment om je voor te bereiden op deze enorme slag in de e-commerce wereld en expert te worden op het gebied van Amazon.

The slogan ‘like no other bike’ says it all.

The workshop is situated in Fabriek aan de Eem, Heliumweg 40, Amersfoort.  Fabriek aan de Eem is a hub with several creative small businesses.

Currently the workshop can train 3 people a time per workshop. 

Aim for the future

A bamboo bicycle for everyone who wants one but build completely by themselves.

The workshops are starting in 2020. We are aiming for a grow model where every year more frames and bicycles will be build than the year before.  Where will it end? No idea.  We will see how it develops. And lets be honest that is the best way to view the future.

The workshops are not the only aim.  Together with the owners of the bamboo bicycles, we hope to organize social events and Bamboo Bicycle rides.  Everyone in bicycle gear of the Bamboo Bicycle Club, what a wonderful aim.

In 2016 Tim discovered in the design museum in London a brilliant aero race bicycle.  The bicycle appeared to be made from bamboo and designed by the Bamboo Bicycle Club.  By the bicycle there was further information about the Bamboo Bicycle Club.  It explained that you could go and build your own frame from bamboo during their weekend workshops.

As Tim is madly enthusiastic about different types of bicycles it was immediately clear that he himself would attend a workshop to build a frame from bamboo. During this workshop he build his own first frame from bamboo under the guidance of James.

Carry forward to 2019.  By pure co-incidence Tim got back in touch with James and both decided that there was a place in Holland to start a Bamboo Bicycle Club.  This is the start of the Bamboo Bicycle club Amersfoort  ",Sports,1-10 employees,2022-04-04T09:50:30.028Z,True

Genieten van je zwembad is geen probleem, maar zorgeloos genieten is een échte uitdaging. En wij helpen je hier graag bij. We hebben twee bijzonder nuttige websites voor je gemaakt: zwembadmannetjes.nl - daar zit je nu op - voor alle tips en tricks voor de aanschaf, het onderhoud en de reiniging van je zwembad. Daarnaast hebben we webshop.zwembadmannetjes.nl voor alle producten om zorgeloos te genieten. 

Ook zijn we natuurlijk te vinden op social media. We delen onze kennis regelmatig op Instagram en Facebook. 

Daarnaast sturen we ook soms e-mails naar de zwembadliefhebbers die niet van verassingen houden. Zo informeren we je bijvoorbeeld ruim van te voren als er onweer aan komt. En leggen uit wat je dan met je zwembad moet doen. Dit kan namelijk behoorlijk invloed hebben op de hoeveelheid chloor in je zwembad. Uiteraard sturen we nooit spam ;)

Ook kan je bij ons terecht als je nog geen zwembad hebt en er eentje wil aanschaffen. Misschien kan de blog over verschillende soorten zwembaden je helpen bij je keuze. Is deze niet geschikt? We hebben nog veel meer blogs over zwembaden.

Kortom wij helpen je graag het maximale uit je zwembad te halen of je die nou al aangeschaft hebt of niet. ","Leisure, Travel & Tourism",1-10 employees,2022-04-04T09:50:34.182Z,True

Onze visie is gebaseerd op een duurzame maatschappelijke behoefte om Someren voor iedereen leefbaar, veilig en goed verzorgd te krijgen.

Leefbaar betekent een groeigemeente met prima algemene voorzieningen die aansluiten bij de behoeftes, goed onderwijs, passende zorg, een bloeiend verenigingsleven, bruisende centra en brede recreatiemogelijkheden!

Veilig betekent dat criminaliteit en strafbaar gedrag onder controle is en inwoners het belang inzien van een schone omgeving. Dat mensen prettig wonen ten behoeve van het persoonlijke welzijn en oog hebben voor elkaar.

Verzorgd betekent dat maatschappelijke (burger)initiatieven en investeringen door ondernemers gestimuleerd worden. Dat inwoners staan voor hun mening en vrijwilligers en mantelzorgers ondersteund worden.

CDA Someren werkt en denkt vanuit vijf kernwaarden:

     1. Respectvol                                         heb aandacht voor elkaar
     2. Eerlijkheid                                          sta voor wat je zegt
     3. In verbinding                                     werk samen en luister
     4. Verantwoordelijkheid                      ben zelfredzaam
     5. Vooruitstrevend                               denk realistisch en vernieuwend

STORY

When my brother and I were young, our mother sometimes used to dress us similarly... same shirts, pants, and shoes. We always fought when that happened, and I still hate him for leaving permanent marks on my arms! 🤣

The pictures I have from those days are my childhood treasures. Once again, we are using clothing and designs to connect with each other. Although the specifics are different, the spirit remains the same.

Instead of aiming solely for profits, we would like Yammeya’s products to instill a sense of community and fraternity into our customers. These are the foundations of society, and we would like to reignite the fun in meeting and socializing.

Along with that, Yammeya is committed to the environment. In The Yammeya Charity Program, we have partnered with Trees for the Future to help combat deforestation.

Our objective is to find extraordinary and - in today’s overwhelming market - somewhat forgotten French wines and bring them to Amsterdam. Our focus lies on the whole of France with a slight predilection for wines from the Loire Valley and Burgundy.

We purchase all our wines directly from the winemaker and for this reason we often travel to France. We select our wines on purity, originality, structure and origin. In other words, we look for wines in which the grape, the winemaker’s touch and the ‘terroir’ can be traced. All of the wines we select are produced organically, biodynamically or with the utmost respect for mother nature.

Déborah obtained the highest diploma of the world’s most renowned institute for wine education, the Wine & Spirit Education Trust (WSET), in 2014 and became a Weinakademiker at the Weinakademie Österreich in 2015 with her thesis ‘Grower Champagne; a new and lasting reality?’. 

Joris was an attorney at law for 10 years before he - guided by his infatuation with wine -  set a new course in 2014. He has obtained the WSET Advanced diploma (with merit) and likes to read and study everything there is on wine.

How it started….

Phing-Things are created by Gert-Jan Vlaming, a dutch artist. He saw with amazement what this little statue does. The reactions that people had when they saw the Phing-Things for the first time was an inspiring moment for him. The Phing-Thing is able to make people feel happy. Phing-Things are meant to ‘spread happiness’.

The concept of spreading happiness is a very simple mission statement with such a powerful effect when achieved. This is about trying to bring a moment of joy to a strangers life. Everybody reacts in a different way and every interaction is an opportunity to spread that happiness a little further.

Everything done fair….

It is important that everything around the Phing-Things is done in a fair and honest way. Spreading happiness start in the way the are made. For the white plaster based Phing-Things, we work with a variety of community based organisations in Holland who create paid work for disabled people for whom it is difficult to find a regular job.

Calmzy is opgericht door persoonlijke ervaring met slecht slapen

Slapen is een dingetje. Niet alleen voor mij, maar wereldwijd voor ontzettend veel mensen. Door dagelijkse drukte en hectiek is het soms lastig om mijn hoofd rust te geven. Dat komt vooral ’s avonds in bed tot uiting. Het moment wanneer de omgeving stil en donker is en de aandacht zich intern naar je gedachten verplaatst.

Mijn gedachten hebben vele verhalen, maar slaap komt daar niet in voor. Ik heb al veel pogingen gedaan om mijn slaap te verbeteren; medicijnen, therapieën, trainingen en mindfulness. Op lange termijn helaas tevergeefs. ADHD speelt een grote rol daarin, maar ik weet dat mensen zonder ADHD er ook last van hebben.

Op een dag lees ik over een verzwaringsdeken. Ik had er nog nooit van gehoord. Het helpt beter te slapen en dieper te slapen. Ik wil graag beter slapen, dus ik bestel een verzwaringsdeken. Ik heb daarna nooit meer hetzelfde geslapen. Waarom heb ik hier nog nooit van gehoord?

k praatte erover met mensen in mijn omgeving. Zij hadden er ook nog nooit van gehoord. Dat moet veranderen dacht ik. Een verzwaringsdeken moet voor iedereen beschikbaar worden. Ik weet immers zelf hoe waardevol dit product in mijn leven is. Ik ben ervan overtuigd dat ik veel mensen kan helpen om beter te slapen.

Mijn naam is Jurgen, en die overtuiging is de reden waarom ik Calmzy opgericht heb. Omdat ik weet dat zoveel mensen graag beter willen slapen. Met dit product bied ik mensen die mogelijkheid. Want ik weet dat mijn leven beter en gezonder wordt wanneer ik goed slaap. Met Calmzy help ik mee aan het verbeteren van de slaap, zodat we met zijn alle gezonder en gelukkiger leven.

4221,11851405,Eva Schreuder Ontwerpen,"“A poem consists of words and the silence in between”
(a free interpretation of a Dutch poem - Martinus Nijhoff)

This poem, written on a wall of the local library near my home, touches the core of my inspiration to make jewelry. I only make half-way-there-products, lost without the wearer. I want to capture the silence in between the words in the jewelry I design, but also invite the wearer to do so with their own silence/memories.

My jewelry should be a marriage between art and a utensil. The icing on the cake is the added sentimental value of the piece.

""Een gedicht bestaat uit woorden en de stilte daar tussen”
(Martinus Nijhoff)
 
Deze zin staat verstopt op een muurtje bij mij op de hoek. Toen ik dit las herkende ik mijn eigen werk. Hetgeen wat ik maak, krijgt pas echt zijn waarde door degene die het draagt en zijn of haar gevoel erbij. Dit is onlosmakelijk met elkaar verbonden. Ik tracht de stilte tussen de woorden te vangen en tegelijkertijd 'ruimte'​ voor de drager te scheppen.

Ik voel me op mijn gemak met meer dan enkel de traditioneel gebruikte materialen voor sieraden. Ik denk dat ik dat mee heb gekregen op de Kunstacademie; buiten de kaders denken. 

In 2006 ben ik afgestudeerd als Sieraadvormgever aan de Kunstacademie in Maastricht. Na mijn afstuderen heb ik gewerkt als docent tekenen en ckv bij het Bonaventura College in Leiden. In 2009 vertrokken mijn man en ik voor 6 maanden naar Azië. Deze reis bleek bij terugkomst het startschot voor het opzetten van een eigen sieradenlabel. De eerste collectie was in 2011 een feit. Sindsdien heb ik meegedaan aan meerdere exposities en beurzen in binnenland (o.a Sieraad Artfair, Meesterlijk, Show Up) en buitenland (o.a. Invasie Antwerpen, Early Bird in Hamburg en Ventura Lambrate in Milaan).

Naast mijn eigen sieradenlijn maak ik graag werk in opdracht, zoals trouwringen en geboorte cadeau's. Maar ook relatiegeschenken, zoals een ketting voor Denham the Jeanmaker. ",Fine Art,1-10 employees,2022-04-04T09:51:12.057Z,True

Wij zijn Dennis en Marlyn en wij zijn De Hardloop Fabriek. Wat leuk dat je onze webshop bezoekt!

Wij verkopen een uitgebreid accessoires assortiment bestaande uit de volgende fantastisch merken Aonijie, Raidlight en ARCh MAX .

Wij zijn deze webshop begonnen omdat wij vinden dat iedereen die van hardlopen houdt of ermee wilt beginnen, niet meteen heel veel geld kwijt hoeft te zijn aan kwalitatief goede en functionele runninggear. 

Tijdens de voorbereiding voor mijn eerste halve marathon werd goede hardloopgear steeds belangrijker, je neemt immers steeds meer mee voor onderweg. Op de gok een racevest besteld en sindsdien kan ik niet zonder. Ook tijdens langere afstanden had ik hier veel plezier van. Ik kreeg steeds vaker de vraag waar ik dit leuk uitziende racevest vandaan had en zo is het balletje gaan rollen. 

Wil je goede en leuk uitziende hardloopaccessoires, maar wil je er niet al teveel geld aan uitgeven, dan ben je bij ons aan het juiste adres.

Samengevat is onze drijfveer een leuk en bijzonder bedrijf neer te zetten dat kwalitatief uitstekende producten verkoopt. Wellicht dat we in de toekomst nog meer uitbreiding in merkenaanbod gaan aanbieden, met uiteraard de service die jullie van ons mogen verwachten. 

Met sportieve groet, 

De Hardloop Fabriek,                                                                                                                         Voor elke kilometer met gemak!

Waarschijnlijk ben je op deze pagina belandt omdat je een gave giveaway of origineel relatiegeschenk zoekt én het milieu een warm hart toedraagt. Daarom vind ik je nu al aardig!

Mijn doel is om de aarde een beetje mooier, groener en schoner te maken. Daarom verkoop ik alleen duurzame producten. Zo geef jij niet alleen je klanten en relaties, maar óók de aarde een cadeautje. 🌏

Ieder jaar belandt er, alleen al in de oceaan, 8 miljoen ton plastic. Dat is een complete vrachtwagen per minuut! Schrik jij daar net zo van als ik?

Je kent vast het beeld van dat zeepaardje dat zich vastklemt aan een wattenstaafje. Plastic is niet alleen een ramp voor het milieu en de dieren, maar ook voor de mens. Plastic vergaat namelijk niet. Het valt hooguit uiteen in kleinere deeltjes. Ook wel plastic soep genoemd. Plastic komt op deze manier onvermijdelijk in onze eigen voedselketen terecht.

De vervuiling van de oceaan is slechts het topje van de ijsberg. En mocht je willen dat jouw kinderen, kleinkinderen of achterkleinkinderen ook nog weten wat een ijsberg is, kies je geschenk dan bewust en met een groen hart 💚",Renewables & Environment,1-10 employees,2022-04-04T09:51:26.898Z,False

4446,533349,Fatboy the original,"Once upon a time Jukka Setälä, a designer from Golla (Finland), was listening to the edgy tunes of Fatboy Slim (no, really!) while designing the 21st century beanbag. This combination of activities resulted in an oversized beanbag of the highest quality with a cheeky huge label on the side. Fatboy® the original was born.

Since the launch on the Dutch market in 2002, the design of Fatboy® proved to sell itself. Within 10 years Fatboy® successfully conquered country after country without using voodoo or cunning marketing tricks.
The only trick in the book was, and still is, to always treat Fatboy® as an established brand and to only act upon opportunities when it's good for Fatboy®.

And now.. there's no stopping the Fatboy® family tree! Gigantic lamps, über-sized umbrellas, magical hammocks and outdoor chandeliers, all designed to add a smile to life.

Selling in over 50 countries and every continent, plus a USA branch...keep your eyes peeled because it is only the start of the Fatboy® legacy.",Consumer Goods,51-200 employees,2022-04-04T10:16:40.553Z,True

HOW WE STARTED
Founded in 2012, Hutspot started as a small pop-up store in the Utrechtsestraat. This Amsterdam based concept offered a unique shopping experience, with extensive possibilities for local entrepreneurs and artists to showcase their product.

Our first official store opened in December 2012 at Van Woustraat in Amsterdam. Next to offering product, the store quickly became a popular hangout due to a spacious lunchroom and friendly barber. The concept was expanded with a second store at Rozengracht in Amsterdam one year later. Following, we opened stores in Utrecht (2015), Rotterdam (2016) and Eindhoven (2017). The Hutspot brand, including a webshop, was launched in 2018.

THREE NEW STORES IN 2019
In 2019, we are planning to open three new stores. Our third store in Amsterdam was opened at Magna Plaza in June, following a store in Breda in August. Hutspot store number eight will open its doors at an unknown location later this year.

4486,363329,Jopen BV Haarlem,"Haarlem was once a city with many breweries. Place names such as Brouwersvaart (Brewers'​ Canal) Brouwerskade (Brewers'​ Quay) and Brouwershofje (Brewers'​ Yard) remind us of this rich history. Beer brewing was by 1400 the most important commercial activity of the city. By the late Middle Ages, beer from Haarlem was exported all over the world, indeed even used as a form of currency in the southern province of Oost Zeeland. It was shipped by the Dutch East India Company to the Orient, and was well known in Flanders (Belgium) and Northern France. In 1995, inspired by all this history and the loss of all the historic breweries, a group of enthusiastic Haarlemmers took up the challenge of putting Haarlem back on the world beer map. That year, after centuries of absence, Haarlems Jopenbier was brought back onto the market. This happily coincided with that year's celebrations of the city's 750th anniversary, bringing a taste of the past with Hoppenbier's recipe, which dates from the year 1501.The success of Jopen (Named after an ancient brewing vessel of 112 litres), was followed by the launch of Jopen KOYT, a beer in which the mediaeval recipe demanded the use of herbs for flavouring rather than hops. In 1999, Jopen ADRIAAN was introduced, a light varient of another herbal beer from 1407.
Encouraged by the success of these beers, the Haarlem brewers brought a unique Bokbier (Traditional Dutch Autumn beer) onto the market.This is brewed from four different grains (Malted barley, wheat, oats, rye), smooth tasting rather than sweet. Jopen Bokbier is the best selling beer from an independent brewery in The Netherlands. Since 2003, there is also a Jopen LENTEBIER (Spring beer) available, which is distinguished by the liberal amount of coriander seeds with which it is brewed.",Food & Beverages,51-200 employees,2022-04-04T10:16:44.407Z,True

4492,5725905,Intergas Verwarming B.V.,"Intergas: an introduction. 

Intergas has, for more than 40 years, been at the forefront of domestic boiler manufacture in the Netherlands. The invention of the 'Double High Efficiency'​ heat exchanger has revolutionized boiler technology. 

Double High Efficiency. 

The Intergas Combi Compact HRE boiler has ground breaking technology and incorporates the latest ’Double High Efficiency’ heat exchanger. Due to the separate central heating and hot water circuits the Intergas Combi Compact HRE doesn’t use a diverter valve and secondary domestic hot water plate heat exchanger. This eliminates a significant source of possible future component failures. Furthermore during hot water usage the pump isn’t in operation thus enhancing the lifespan of this critical component.

Reliable technology, easy to maintain. 

All parts in the Combi Compact HRE boiler are easily accessible as the boiler case can be easily removed from the front. Furthermore, most parts are interchangeable throughout the entire range thus reducing the need to carry endless amounts of spare parts. The double two-in-one heat exchanger of the Intergas Combi Compact HRE high-efficiency boiler has proven to be extremely reliable. That is why Intergas gives a warranty of 10 years on its heat exchanger. The Combi Compact boiler not only works with the regular ‘on/off’ thermostats but also with programmable room thermostats.",Consumer Goods,201-500 employees,2022-04-04T10:16:48.507Z,False

Qlip plays an important role herein. We provide independent quality assurance throughout the dairy chain. We provide audits and analyses in the field of food safety, quality, composition and sustainability. And we do this for the entire dairy chain, from farm to retail.

Our auditors conduct over 13,000 audits and reviews of the functioning and fulfillment of specific quality systems annually. We also have the world's largest dairy laboratory with state-of-the-art technology. About 15 million milk samples from cows and goats are analyzed in this laboratory each year. Our qualified employees perform over half a million chemical and microbiological analyses. This results in large amounts of valuable data on a daily basis. With this information, dairy companies and dairy farmers can optimize their processes and business operations.

Our internal quality system is designed to ensure that our operations comply with recognized national and international standards, regulations and guidelines. Various accreditation norms describe how we have to deal with these critical points. The Dutch Accreditation Council, an independent body, determines annually whether our business fulfills the requirements. 

Continuous development of our knowledge and expertise is crucial. We collaborate with customers, research institutes and suppliers to develop new technologies, standards, methods and products. A striking example of successful innovation is the fresh grazed grass indicator. We have made it possible to determine in milk whether cows have been grazing grass outside in the meadow.

We share our specific knowledge and expertise with the international dairy chain through trainings and workshops. In Europe, but also in Asia.

4534,111312,BOSKA,"At BOSKA we make Food Tools for Life and we believe quality = sustainability. Our goal is to design products that last a lifetime. It all began near Gouda, in Holland, where blacksmith Willem Bos made his first cheese tools for the local farmers. From that day on it’s been our family's tradition to create fun & smart tools so you can enjoy cheese, chocolate, pizza, meat and veggie to the fullest. We love it! 

So whether you’re cutting, slicing, grating, grilling or melting, we'll help you create mouthwatering food and a party on your table. Enjoy!


THE 3 THINGS WE DO BEST:
1. Consumer Food Tools 
From cheese graters to fonduesets and from pizza wheels to serving boards: with BOSKA Food Tools you will get maximum enjoyment from cheese, chocolate, pizza and more. All our food tools are of exceptional quality and designed to last a lifetime. Perfect for foodies and true epicureans! With these tools you have everything you need for an informal party or festive event at home.

2. Professional Cheese Tools 
Our roots lie in Cheesewares for cheese professionals. From the cheesy heart of the Netherlands, we work closely together with cheesemakers and cheesemongers. Whether it involves dividing, cutting, slicing, grating or vacuum packaging from cheese. We help them efficiently, present it beautifully in their stores, and increase their cheese sales. 

3. Brand Builders 
Looking for an original gift for your business relations or colleagues? Want to put your logo on our Cheesewares? Or even a custom product from the ground up? These are true brand builders. We design custom-made Cheesewares for companies, gadgets for goodiebags, and eyecatchers for mailings. We even design complete product lines with retailers and monobrands. We won’t back down from any marketing challenge.

Our mission is to make products that:
1. Are affordable for the many
2. Are fun to use
3. Have a timeless design
4. Last a lifetime

The Amazing Company. Dat klinkt als een buitengewoon bedrijf. Dat zijn we natuurlijk ook. Maar we staan met beide voeten op de grond. Want dromen is mooi, maar dromen komen alleen uit als je wakker blijft. Toch begon het ooit met een droom: klanten voorzien in alle grote (A-)merken consumentenelektronica en wit- en bruingoed. 

Die droom startte in 1999 met het eerste pakketje vanuit de woning van Theo Engels in Schijndel. Dit werd al gauw ingeruild voor een prachtig bedrijfspand. Nu gevestigd in ’s-Hertogenbosch met een logistiek centrum in Rosmalen en extern warehouse in Hedel. En met succesvolle dochterondernemingen als Megami, Gezamenlijk Voordeel en Quecom. 

Amacom verzorgt de dagelijkse inkoop, verkoop en distributie voor grote en kleine e-tailers en retailers in de Benelux. Ondersteund door ons eigen online bestel- en informatiesysteem Quecom levert Amacom zes dagen per week, binnen 24 uur, rechtstreeks aan klanten, (web)winkels, pick-up points en magazijnen. 

We geven het direct toe: onze producten zijn overal te koop. Maar zoek je een distributie- en fulfilmentpartner voor wie geen vraag te gek is? Waar mensen werken die je kunt bellen en waar je altijd langs mag komen? Die je blijft verbazen en alles voor je doet? Dan kies je voor Amacom! 

We blijven inzetten op groei. Om die woorden kracht bij te zetten hebben we de handen ineengeslagen met Exertis, een toonaangevende Britse distributeur in onder meer consumentenelektronica, zakelijke communicatiemiddelen, audiovisuele hulpmiddelen en netwerkvoorzieningen. 

Toch zijn we nog altijd hetzelfde warme familiaire bedrijf zoals in de beginjaren. Dat kan alleen met de juiste mensen. We zijn een team van echte aanpakkers. Want onze verantwoordelijkheid stopt niet als een pakket de deur uit is. Die stopt pas als de klant 100% tevreden is. Bij iedere bestelling en ieder pakket geven wij een snufje van onze paarse magie mee.

We build on the potential of potatoes and people to develop new potato varieties that add value for all parties in the value chain. Our varieties perform better in changing circumstances and contribute to better availability and more enjoyment for everybody.

We develop and market high value potatoes that make a difference to people around the world.

Our story starts with Kees Meijer Sr when he became a potato trader, more than 100 years ago, in 1920. He wanted to give his family and himself a better life. His entrepreneurial spirit and focus on the potential of potatoes were essential for his success and still form the foundation of Meijer Potato.

Building on potential
Kees Sr started as a trader. When his son Henk joined the business, he added an international, customer-oriented approach with which he further developed the company. Later, his grandson Kees Jr also joined the family company. He became the driving force behind the expansion of the company into a potato chain. Today, the fourth generation of the Meijer family has joined the company. Meijer management and former and current staff contributed to the company’s entrepreneurial spirit by expressing their own talent and vision in their work. In this way, we both utilize and nourish people’s potential.

Our people built a solid base for Meijer Potato. The history nourishes our faith in the potato, in its potential as food and as a source of economic value and welfare. We have a great deal of trust in our people who fulfill that potential. Potatoes are an important source of personal and economic growth and our means to contribute to more enjoyment and wellbeing.",Food Production,51-200 employees,2022-04-04T10:16:59.943Z,False

Als grootste online plantstore van Europa, maken we niet alleen dagelijks jouw omgeving groener, maar ook de wereld een stukje mooier.  

𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐞𝐧 𝐦𝐚𝐚𝐤𝐭 𝐠𝐞𝐥𝐮𝐤𝐤𝐢𝐠 
Planten boosten je energie, verhogen je creativiteit en geven je rust. Dat blijkt niet alleen uit onderzoek, je merkt het zelf ook meteen. Dus omring jezelf met meer groen. Vrolijk je vensterbanken op. En ont-tegel je tuin. Growing Happiness noemen we dat. 
  
𝟏𝟎𝟎% 𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐞𝐢- & 𝐛𝐥𝐨𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐞

Vaak zitten onze planten nog in de knop, maar no worries. Ze verdrogen daardoor minder snel, zijn beter beschermd en bloeien ook langer bij jou in huis of in de tuin.  

𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐬𝐭𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐞𝐧

Sparta vindt het belangrijk om zich te onderscheiden. We hebben altijd zin in iets nieuws en maken de fiets steeds beter. Onze pay-off is ook niet voor niets: 'Something Special'​. 

Een statement dat ons uitdaagt om constant te kijken naar de kwaliteit en toepassingen van de Sparta-fiets. Dit blijkt uit alles wat we doen. Neem bijvoorbeeld de ontwikkeling van de mamafiets of de introductie van echte ‘lifestyle-modellen’ als de moderne versie van de oer-Hollandse transportfiets, het begon allemaal bij Sparta. En vergeet natuurlijk de elektrische fiets niet.

In 1937 startte Hendrikus Holland samen met zijn vrouw een kleine ambachtelijke bakkerij aan het Oosteinde, de dorpsstraat van Vriezenveen. In die tijd was hij één van de vele bakkers die ons dorp kende. Getypeerd door de traditionele bakfiets en een winkeltje aan de straat, zoals ook veel andere bakkers dat hadden, was het begin van Bakkerij Holland een feit.

Al snel kwam de ondernemersgeest van Hendrikus boven en zag hij in dat als hij zou willen overleven tussen al die andere bakkers, hij zich zou moeten onderscheiden. Zo kwam hij op het idee om lijnmatig te gaan bakken, wat voor die tijd echt bijzonder was. Door deze automatisering kon Bakkerij Holland op grote schaal bakken en samenwerkingen aan gaan met grote afnemers en supermarktketens. Niet alleen in Nederland, maar ook in Duitsland, België, Luxemburg en Frankrijk kwamen er mooie samenwerkingen waardoor verdere uitbreiding van wens naar noodzaak ging. In 1999 heeft Bakkerij Holland haar tweede filiaal geopend in Roosendaal en tot op heden bezig met verder automatiseren, innoveren en het verduurzamen van onze twee bakkerijen.

Bakkerij Holland is een professioneel familiebedrijf waarin een hoge mate van betrokkenheid de boventoon voert. Door onze interne korte lijnen kunnen wij snel schakelen en hebben wij echt oog voor onze medewerkers: bij ons vind je nog oprechte collegialiteit op de werkvloer!

Samen met al onze collega’s zijn wij continue op zoek naar nieuwe uitdagingen en mogelijkheden om te groeien. Wij geven onze medewerkers volop de ruimte om zich binnen de organisatie te ontwikkelen.

Our natural vinegar and syrups make the world healthier, cleaner or more tasteful.

Mission
We make this happen by playing a leading role worldwide in a sustainable and fair way with natural vinegar and, in markets selected by us, with syrups. 

Values
Words that apply to us are Progressive, Sustainable, Pleasurable and Flexible.

Natural vinegar								
At Burg Group, we believe in the strength of natural vinegar, also with respect to food and health. We manufacture our natural vinegar to an exceptionally high degree of acidity of 24%. This renders natural vinegar particularly suitable for low-cost bulk transport in Europe and elsewhere. We supply natural vinegar as a semi-manufacture for the food industry, but also as an end product in consumer packing. The same applies to our wine vinegar, cider vinegar and herbal vinegar as well as our organic and balsamic vinegar.

Cleaning vinegar
We believe in the strength of natural vinegar, also as an alternative to cleaning products. Cleaning vinegar is an environment-friendly and budget-friendly cleaning product that is highly effective. As a cleaning product it can be used for many applications in and around the house. The classic cleaning vinegar belongs to the wide assortment of cleaning products we offer, such as cleaning vinegar gels and sprayers, or special cleaners for the bathroom, kitchen, windows and mirrors.

Syrups
We are proud of our delicious syrups with a great many surprising flavours for children and adults to enjoy every day. Burg Group stands out by making syrups organic and natural, with less calories and with the finest flavour. What is in the syrups is stated in all honesty. 
We supply fruit cordials in all flavours and compositions imaginable. In addition, we have sugar-free syrups, concentrated juices, ice tea, vegetable syrups and fruit mixes in our assortment.

4780,1958191,Koninklijke Ruig,"Het is 1891. De wereld van familiebedrijf Ruig omvat niet meer dan een oude bakfiets, een boerderij en het Amstelhotel als klant voor verse eieren. De schepper van Ruig, Pieter Ruig, had koopmansbloed want hij breidde zijn assortiment al snel uit met de handel in kippen. In die tijd was kip een typisch luxe- en horecaproduct. Pas in de tweede helft van de jaren vijftig nam door de toenemende welvaart de markt voor gevogelte enorm toe. Horecaondernemers werden door de mogelijkheden van het opdelen van kip op maat door Ruig bediend en particulieren konden hun poeliersproducten in de nieuwe winkel in Amsterdam kopen.

Het leveren van eerlijke, ambachtelijke producten van topkwaliteit wordt de inspiratie voor poelier Ruig. Mede door productvernieuwing en het voortdurend aanpassen van productiewijze aan de sterk veranderde maatschappij groeide het bedrijf flink. Inmiddels zijn we vele jaren verder en heeft Ruig zich ontwikkeld als leverancier en producent van kwalitatief wild en gevogelte voor de professionele keuken. Sinds 1994 is Ruig als Verspartner van Sligro gevestigd in 36 zelfbedieningsvestigingen. Daarnaast worden de wild en gevogelte producten van Ruig geleverd via de Bezorgservice-groothandels van Sligro. Sinds 1997 levert Ruig ook een kwalitatief hoogwaardig bake-off assortiment onder de naam Loustain.

Shortly after the second world war, one of Brinkers’ sons started a new venture introducing a brand new product: a chilled chocolate butter, Choba. This product was basically the first chocolate spread ever on the market and even today, Choba is still a very well-known product on the Dutch market. Later on, already in the early sixties, Choba was followed by Nusco, the now classic hazelnut chocolate spread. 

For the past 25 years, the company is managed by the fourth generation Brinkers: a highly experienced management team, together with a very committed and loyal work-force, ready to face all the new challenges the food industry will experience in the years to follow. Brinkers'​ goal is very clear: to further build a successful family-business, based on flexibility, quality, sustainability and a no-nonsense management style.

Brinkers has over the years successfully developed brands in every segment of the international marketplace:

Organic: La Vida Vegan, La Vida Vegan PROTEIN, So Vegan So Fine, So Vegan So Fine PROTEIN, Chocolate Rhapsody, It’s My Life, Nuscobio, Nuscarobe

Conventional: Chocolate Symphony, Nusco, Nusco PROTEIN, Nusco Palm oil-free & Vegan, Nusica, Nusica PROTEIN, BubbleChoq, Twist

It is her unique way to reevaluate reality and so to express and underline individuality.

The essence of van Herpen is expressing the character  and emotions of a woman and to extend the shape of the feminine body in detail. She mixes craftsmanship- using old and forgotten techniques- with innovation and materials inspired on the world to come.

“For me fashion is an expression of art that is very close related to me and to my body.
I see it as my expression of identity combined with desire, moods and cultural setting.

In all my work I try to make clear that fashion is an artistic expression, showing and wearing art, and not just a functional and devoid of content or commercial tool. With my work I intend to show that fashion can certainly have an added value to the world,  that it can be timeless and that its consumption can be less important then its beginning. Wearing clothing creates an exciting and imperative form of self-expression. 'Form follows function'​ is not a slogan with which I concur. On the contrary, I find that forms complement and change the body and thus the emotion. Movement, so essential to and in the body, is just as important in my work. By bringing form, structure and  materials together in a new manner, I try to suggest and realize optimal tension and movement.”

Iris her designs require every time an unique treatment of material or even the creation of complete new materials. For this reason, Van Herpen prefers interdisciplinary research
and often collaborates with other artists or scientists.",Apparel & Fashion,11-50 employees,2022-04-20T16:29:41.381Z,True

Tacx is an innovative company with great passion for sport and technique. This passion drives the organisation and can be seen in all departments; from purchasing to production and product development to logistics.

WE LOVE CYCLING
Since the beginning we have been highly involved in cycling, which has always guided us in our decisions and brought us to where we are today. When riders required high quality bike parts, we made this happen by producing them ourselves. When riders required a way to warm-up before a race, we started making rollers. When riders needed to train effectively during winter, we started making indoor bike trainers. And when more efficiency was required in their training, we made them interactive.  

INVENTING THE FUTURE
We have a history of inventing the future. We take up the greatest challenges and keep pushing limits of what is technically possible to create ground-breaking products with state-of-the-art designs. We were the first to connect computer electronics to bike trainers , in the year 2000, and introduce an entirely new way of training. In 2015 we develop the NEO Smart; the most accurate, realistic, powerful and silent trainer to date, thanks to a unique piece of trainer technology. Parallel to the development of the NEO we develop the Magnum: the first treadmill you can cycle on, enabling you to ride completely free and experience actual inclines.

Roetz maakt fietsen op basis van hergebruikte onderdelen van weesfietsen en creëert daarmee werk en een opleidingstraject binnen een industrie die zit te springen om mensen. In augustus 2016 heeft Roetz een sociale fietsfabriek geopend aan het Gedempt Hamerkanaal in Amsterdam Noord.

Roetz heeft zowel een groene als een sociale missie. Fietsen krijgen een tweede leven, mensen een tweede kans. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat mensen met kwetsbaarheden even goed mee kunnen draaien op de reguliere arbeidsmarkt. Om deze overtuiging kracht bij te zetten hebben we ons middels een prestatielening gecommitteerd aan een concrete doelstelling; in 2021 hebben 10 makers een arbeidsovereenkomst van 24u per week voor de duur van ten minste 1 jaar. 

Voor het aanmelden van kandidaten kan je contact opnemen met onze participatieregisseur via info@roetz-bikes.nl.

We don’t judge a book by its cover: where others see waste and inability, we see useful materials and promising talent. At the Amsterdam-based Roetz Fair Factory, men and women with poor job prospects make new bikes from discarded ones. By hand and with pride. We train them to become skilled bicycle technicians and do everything in our power to help them find permanent employment. 

We want nothing less than changing the world for the better. That is why we are a Social Enterprise putting social impact first. With the Fair Factory, we prove that running a business and having a social heart can go hand in hand.",Consumer Goods,11-50 employees,2022-04-20T16:30:05.690Z,True

Toen Michael Bruinsma al die jaren geleden 999 Games begon, was het aanbod op de spelletjesmarkt in Nederland al tientallen jaren nagenoeg onveranderd, vernieuwing was er nauwelijks. Op de buitenlandse markt was niet alleen dat aanbod er wel, het was ook nog eens uitdagender en leuker dan de spellen die in Nederland beschikbaar waren. Zorgen dat mensen zich hier bewust van worden, hen nieuwe spellen laten ervaren en deze zo goed mogelijk op de Nederlandse en Belgische markt beschikbaar te laten komen op een manier waarop consumenten dat het liefst zien, is sindsdien de missie van 999 Games. 

De focus van 999 Games ligt primair op de familiespeler, maar in de basis proberen we heel Nederland en België net zo enthousiast te krijgen voor (bord)spelletjes als wij zelf ook zijn. Dat betekent dat wij ook spellen voor andere doelgroepen uitgeven. Denk hierbij aan jongvolwassenen en starters, “hardcore” bordspelfanaten en jonge kinderen (en alles wat daar tussenin zit). Daarbij proberen we spellen met verschillende mechanismen en in diverse prijscategorieën aan te bieden. Diversificatie en productontwikkeling zijn dus de belangrijkste pilaren van ons bedrijf.

Epson is a Japanese brand that evolved from Seiko – best known as one of the world’s foremost watchmakers. During the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964, we developed ground breaking new electronic timing equipment which allowed race results to be printed out. Shortly after this innovation, in 1968, we launched the EP-101, the world’s smallest and first digital printer, from which the name Epson, the son of the EP was born. We’ve continued innovating ever since, and now we’re one of the best-selling and most innovative brands in just about every market in which we operate. 

This page deals with our business in the Netherlands. Sister companies within our group manage their own pages to cater for other regions. 

We constantly strive to create innovative products that are reliable, recyclable and energy efficient because at Epson, we know that planning for the future requires a strong commitment to the environment.

But as the people behind a razor brand, we also believe that...

It shouldn’t matter what kind of circumstances you were born into. Everyone deserves an equal chance to make something of themselves. If they want to.

Everyone benefits from the courage of real people doing real things to better their situation. Whatever their odds!

Doing something whatever it is, is better than doing nothing. Every time.

Before long, the shop had become our very own laboratory and the brand gsus was born. We sold the first couple of collections out of a car trunk and then moved into our first real office building (old warehouse) in Amsterdam.

Nothing is as personal and unique as a tailor-made outfit in which you as a person are the starting point. We developed our own working method for this that forms the common thread in what we do: slow tailoring. This is the combination of personal design, authentic craftsmanship and modern innovations. Our tailors create your wedding suit, tailor-made suit and/or tailor-made shirt based on this slow tailoring principle.

We strive to create a place where men can discover their personal style in a casual atmosphere and at the same time make valuable connections. As entrepreneurs, we find nothing more inspiring than meeting (new) people. This keeps us moving.

Our story begins in the seventeenth century, when master clockmaker Ahasuerus Fromanteel and his family moved into a small workshop in the center of Amsterdam. Together with his son, mister Fromanteel revolutionized the clock-making industry by implementing the newly discovered pendulum mechanism into a series of standing clocks, which from that point on were suddenly able to tell time with an accuracy unlike anything the world had ever seen.

Today we remember and celebrate the Fromanteel legacy by carrying on his name for a new generation of Amsterdam watchmakers. Just like Ahasuerus, our offices and Concept Store are located deep in the heart of Amsterdam, along the famous Keizersgracht. 

Our watches are carefully assembled by true Swiss craftsmen in the Fromanteel Swiss Atelier in the city of Bienne – guaranteeing a constant quality befitting of the Fromanteel name. The designs are as effortless as Amsterdam itself: stylish, elegant, functional and playful.

The doors of our Concept Store on the Keizersgracht 241 are open on Monday through Friday, between the hours of 9.30 and 17.30. Every visitor is greeted with a warm smile and a hot cup of coffee. Curious? Please do not hesitate to knock on our door.
